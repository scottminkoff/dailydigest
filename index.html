    <div class="content"><h4>Saturday, December 20, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that authorities have discovered the body of Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, the suspect in the shootings at Brown University and the killing of an M.I.T. professor. Police found Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national and former Brown graduate student, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a New Hampshire storage unit after receiving a tip from a Reddit user regarding a suspicious vehicle.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Atlantic notes that the Justice Department faces a deadline to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, following legislation passed by Congress. While Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche indicated several hundred thousand documents would be released, he noted others would follow in the coming weeks, potentially missing the strict statutory deadline.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook reports that President Donald Trump is heading to North Carolina for the second leg of his "affordability tour." This comes as the administration announced deals with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices, while Congress leaves Washington without extending Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch covers the Trump administration's moves to affix the president's name to federal assets, including a vote by the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to rename the venue the "Trump-Kennedy Center."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Puck reports on the quiet reemergence of Jared Kushner as an "off-the-books diplomat" in Trump’s second term, noting his involvement in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and recent negotiations with Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO highlights that Erika Kirk, CEO of Turning Point USA, endorsed Vice President JD Vance for president in 2028 at the organization's AmericaFest conference, laying down an early marker for the next election cycle.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State NY reports that Rep. Elise Stefanik has suspended her campaign for governor and announced she will not seek reelection to Congress. In a statement, Stefanik cited the difficulty of an "unnecessary and protracted Republican primary" against Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who has secured the backing of the state GOP.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Times Union covers Governor Kathy Hochul signing a package of prison oversight bills spurred by the deaths of two incarcerated individuals, as well as a bill repealing the "100-foot rule," which previously subsidized natural gas hookups for new customers.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO New York reports that New York City Mayor Eric Adams appointed two new members and reappointed two others to the Rent Guidelines Board. This move is seen as potentially impeding Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s campaign pledge to freeze rents on regulated apartments.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch reflects on the recent terror attack at a Hanukkah celebration in Bondi Beach, Australia, where shooters motivated by ISIS ideology killed 15 people. The newsletter discusses the resilience of Jewish communities globally in the face of rising antisemitism.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gary Rosenblatt criticizes New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani for his response to the Bondi Beach attack, arguing that Mamdani ignores the connection between the violence and anti-Zionist rhetoric like "global intifada."</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch reports that seven years after Donald Trump declared victory over ISIS, the group remains a potent threat, operating regional affiliates and inspiring attacks worldwide, including the recent ambush of U.S. service members in Syria and the attack in Australia.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook notes that Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his stance that the war in Ukraine will continue until his conditions are met, though he expressed some openness to discussing proposals made by President Trump.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Slow Boring discusses the passing of director Rob Reiner and criticizes President Trump's disparaging comments about him, using Reiner's film *A Few Good Men* to analyze the conservative belief in strongman leadership.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Argument argues that rather than creating new programs like Universal Basic Income to handle AI-induced job displacement, the U.S. should modernize and shore up its existing Unemployment Insurance system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kottke.org highlights a report on the "Great Data Center Slowdown," noting that local NIMBY opposition is hindering the rapid scaling of AI infrastructure.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that the Texas Tech University system is implementing a new administrative review process that is pressing faculty to scrutinize course content for "relevance" and "necessity," raising concerns about academic freedom regarding topics like race and gender.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Chronicle of Higher Education also covers the firing of employees at Clemson University following backlash over social media posts involving Charlie Kirk, revealing how administrators scrambled to manage political demands.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Puck reports on the ongoing bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery, with fresh intelligence suggesting the WBD board remains wary of the Paramount/Skydance bid due to financing questions involving Larry Ellison and Middle East sovereign wealth funds.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch's Nick Catoggio compares President Trump's recent address on the affordability crisis to Jimmy Carter's "malaise speech," arguing that Trump seems to be blaming Americans for their lack of faith in him.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Ross Douthat argues that Marco Rubio is "winning the Trump era" by avoiding becoming a media fixation while quietly handling his role as Secretary of State.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Yair Rosenberg, writing in The Atlantic, critiques J.D. Vance's response to rising antisemitism, arguing that making the issue about ideological enemies and immigration fails to address the generational shift in prejudice.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonah Goldberg in The Dispatch criticizes the "Heritage American" concept popular on the online right, arguing that creating a hierarchy of Americanness based on lineage undermines the idea that anyone can become American by embracing the country's founding ideals.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall observes a feeling of "drift, spectacle and fragmentation" in the Trump administration, characterizing moves like renaming the Kennedy Center as "North Korean aesthetics of power" masking a lack of coherent governance.</p></div>
