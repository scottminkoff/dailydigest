        <h4><b>New York State Government and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul met with President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., during the National Governors Association meeting, reporting a "reassuring" outcome regarding potential federal interventions in New York. Trump reportedly told the governor that his administration would not deploy an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) surge or the National Guard to New York unless explicitly requested by the state. This development de-escalates recent rhetoric suggesting a unilateral federal crackdown on New York City’s sanctuary status and crime rates. However, Hochul noted she would hold the administration to this commitment while maintaining readiness to request federal aid if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a notice to appeal a federal court decision that upheld New York's "Green Light Law," which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses while shielding their data from federal immigration authorities. In a related development indicating increased federal pressure, the state Department of Motor Vehicles is discontinuing a program that facilitated licenses for foreign nationals with temporary residency status following threats to federal funding. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins has reportedly assembled a working group of top Democrats to craft new proposals limiting information-sharing between local governments and federal agencies in response to these pressures. This legal tug-of-war highlights the escalating conflict between New York's sanctuary protections and the Trump administration's immigration enforcement agenda.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A state judge has ruled that litigation against the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) regarding the HALT Act may proceed as a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the state has illegally suspended required rehabilitative programming and out-of-cell time for incarcerated individuals following last year's correction officer strike. While DOCCS Commissioner Daniel Martuscello III cited staffing shortages as the reason for the suspension and claimed recruitment is improving, the judge determined the allegations represented an immediate threat requiring collective relief. This ruling significantly raises the stakes for the state, as a judgment could mandate sweeping operational changes across the prison system.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The political landscape for the upcoming legislative elections is taking shape with several retirements and primary challenges emerging. Progressive Assembly Member Steven Raga is launching a bid to succeed retiring State Senator Michael Gianaris in western Queens, setting up a clash with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) on their home turf. Meanwhile, Rep. Adriano Espaillat has endorsed Assembly Member Eddie Gibbs for reelection, a reversal from his support of a challenger two years ago. On Long Island, David McDonough, the oldest state legislator, announced he will not seek reelection, with a 29-year-old Senate staffer poised to replace him on the ballot.</p>

<h4><b>New York Local Government and Politics (Non-NYC)</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A controversial plan to convert a warehouse in Orange County into a federal immigration detention facility has been halted. Assembly Member Brian Maher confirmed that the proposal, which involved a property owned by a former Trump adviser, will not materialize following significant local pushback. This cancellation represents a victory for local opponents who feared the facility would bring federal immigration enforcement conflicts into the Hudson Valley. The stoppage aligns with broader state efforts to resist the expansion of federal detention infrastructure within New York.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The City of Buffalo is slated to receive $40 million in direct state aid to help close a substantial budget deficit. If approved in the final state budget, this package would include a $30 million lump-sum payment and $10 million in Temporary Municipal Aid. This infusion of funds is critical for the municipality's fiscal stability as it navigates economic headwinds. The aid package highlights the state's role in stabilizing the finances of its major upstate cities amid varying local economic conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Onondaga County Legislator Maurice Brown has announced a primary challenge against longtime state Assemblyman Bill Magnarelli for a Central New York seat. Brown, who has served in the county legislature since 2023, is positioning himself as a new voice against the veteran incumbent. This challenge represents another test for establishment Democrats in upstate regions facing pressure from younger, often more progressive candidates. The race will likely focus on local economic development and the effectiveness of long-term incumbency in Albany.</p>

<h4><b>New York City Government and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have doubled their official bloc in the New York City Council by admitting Council Members Chi Ossé and Shahana Hanif. They join existing members Tiffany Cabán and Alexa Avilés, strengthening the socialist wing's ability to influence city legislation. This expanded coalition is already prioritizing a push for a "Small Business Rent Stabilization Act," modeled after residential rent protections. The move signals an aggressive legislative strategy from the city's left flank to regulate commercial real estate markets.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Tensions between Mayor Zohran Mamdani and City Council Speaker Julie Menin are rising over public safety and budgeting. Speaker Menin has publicly criticized the Mayor's decision not to increase NYPD ranks, noting officer counts have dropped to levels not seen since 9/11. Concurrently, a federal monitor reported that the NYPD continues to engage in unconstitutional policing and unlawful stops, complicating the debate over staffing versus reform. Additionally, Mamdani's budget proposal, which threatens property tax hikes if the state refuses to tax the wealthy, is facing scrutiny as either a political bluff or a serious fiscal ultimatum.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez is calling for a comprehensive review of city contracts signed during the administration of former Mayor Eric Adams. The call comes in the wake of indictments involving ex-NYPD officials, raising concerns about potential corruption or mismanagement in previous procurement processes. This retrospective scrutiny aims to identify any irregularities that may have persisted into the current governance structure. The initiative underscores the City Council's intent to exercise rigorous oversight over executive spending and ethics.</p>
