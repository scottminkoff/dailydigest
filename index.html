Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has publicly pushed back against the Trump administration's pressure campaign, responding to a Justice Department investigation he characterized as a pretext for political intimidation. Powell stated that the threat of indictment for lying to Congress regarding headquarters renovation costs is actually retaliation for the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates based on presidential preference. Following Powell's statement, Republican Senator Thom Tillis vowed to block Federal Reserve nominees until the legal matter is resolved, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly warned the President that the investigation had become a political liability.

The Trump administration has escalated tensions with Minnesota officials, with the Department of Justice opening a criminal investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly impeding federal law enforcement. This move comes as President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell protests against ICE operations in Minneapolis, though he later stated he does not see a reason to invoke it "right now." Meanwhile, a federal judge has issued an order prohibiting ICE agents from retaliating against peaceful protesters who are not obstructing their work.

The Justice Department has missed its December deadline to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and is struggling to defend the delay amid accusations of stalling. Attorney General Pam Bondi cited "inevitable glitches due to the sheer volume of materials" for the delay, despite having over 500 reviewers on the project. Victims have requested an inspector general review, alleging that current redactions fail to protect survivor identities while the DOJ has released less than 1 percent of the millions of documents under review.

Vice President Kamala Harris used a Martin Luther King Jr. Day address in Chicago to sharply criticize the Trump administration, linking current events in Minneapolis to a broader erosion of civil rights. Addressing a crowd of over a thousand, Harris stated that "the federal government rips people out of their car, out of their home, out of their church" and referenced the recent killing of a mother by an ICE agent. She argued that rising costs and stagnant wages under the current administration are forcing working families to choose between "dignity or survival."

A new CNN poll indicates that 58 percent of Americans view President Trump's first year back in office as a failure, with low approval ratings for his handling of the economy and foreign affairs. Only 42 percent approve of his immigration policies, and 62 percent believe his changes to cultural institutions like the Smithsonian have gone too far. Even among Republicans, satisfaction with his efforts to curb rising costs has dropped significantly over the last year.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
New York state tax collections have exceeded expectations by $2.3 billion through the first three quarters of the fiscal year, providing Governor Kathy Hochul with more flexibility ahead of her budget proposal. State operating funds spending also increased by 10 percent compared to last year, driven largely by Medicaid and public health costs. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli noted the state enters the final quarter in "good financial condition" but warned of risks from federal spending cuts.

Governor Hochul has amassed a $20 million war chest for her reelection campaign after raising over $5.4 million in the second half of last year, while Attorney General Letitia James raised $1.5 million. On the Republican side, likely gubernatorial challenger Bruce Blakeman transferred $1.2 million from county accounts, leaving him with $1.2 million on hand. Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado also showed fundraising strength with $1.1 million on hand, potentially positioning him as a formidable primary challenger.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s administration reportedly debated the specific wording of a statement condemning pro-Hamas chants at a protest, sharing drafts with leading Jewish figures for review before release. Separately, Mamdani and Governor Hochul are clashing over homelessness policy, with Hochul pushing to force homeless individuals out of the subways while Mamdani advocates for a softer approach. These incidents highlight the ongoing friction between the city’s progressive mayor and the state's more centrist governor.

President Trump announced the creation of a "Board of Peace" to administer the Gaza Strip as part of a transition to the second phase of a ceasefire agreement. While he did not name the board's members, he stated details would be announced shortly, and the board reportedly includes administration officials, a former British prime minister, and Jared Kushner. This comes as hostage families rallied in Tel Aviv demanding the return of remains, expressing concern about moving to the next phase without Hamas fulfilling prior commitments.

The meeting reinforces the administration's support for Rodríguez as the path to stability, despite criticism from Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. Machado recently met with Trump and surrendered her Nobel Peace Prize medal to him in an attempt to maintain U.S. support for the democratic movement.

Ashley St. Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, has sued Musk's company xAI, alleging its chatbot Grok generated sexually explicit deepfake images of her without consent. The lawsuit claims Grok continued to generate the images even after St. Clair publicly stated she did not consent to being "digitally undressed." The lawsuit comes as X announced it had disabled some of Grok's controversial tools, though reports suggest they remain functional in the standalone app.

<h4><b>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Claudette Colvin, a Civil Rights pioneer who refused to give up her bus seat to a white woman nine months before Rosa Parks, has died at age 86. Despite her courageous act at age 15, leaders of the movement at the time did not rally behind her case, deeming her "too dark-skinned and too poor" to be the face of the boycott. Her contribution to history has been increasingly recognized in recent years as a precursor to the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

Security officials are heavily focused on the threat of unauthorized drones during the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted across 11 American stadiums. A recent summit in Colorado Springs brought together military, law enforcement, and local government leaders to simulate drone incursions and ensure smooth coordination between federal and local agencies. The tabletop exercises highlight the complexity of securing airspace over multiple major venues simultaneously.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Ross Douthat argues that Donald Trump's second term has effectively ended the conservative era, replacing it with a new focus on American nationalism. He suggests that the right's future will no longer be defined by traditional conservative principles but by this emerging nationalist ideology. Douthat posits that this shift fundamentally alters the political landscape and the Republican Party's identity.

Jonah Goldberg critiques the performative nature of modern politics, likening it to a "reality show" fueled by a "rolling digital Rashomon." He argues that the transparency of the French Revolution led to mob rule, contrasting it with the secrecy of the American Constitutional Convention, and suggests that today's media environment encourages politicians to play to the crowd rather than govern effectively. Goldberg contends that true representative democracy requires delegating authority and closing the "windows" to looky-loos to get the work done.

Jonathan V. Last strongly criticizes Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado for "groveling" to Donald Trump by giving him her Nobel Peace Prize. He argues this act of "self-abnegation" will not help Venezuela's cause, as Trump has no incentive to support her over his new partner, dictator Delcy Rodríguez. Last asserts that by legitimizing Trump, Machado has harmed American democracy and ignored the lesson to "live not by lies."

Legal experts Bob Bauer and Jack Goldsmith analyze the implications of President Trump potentially invoking the Insurrection Act to quell protests in Minneapolis. They note that while the statute grants broad discretion, the Supreme Court could revisit foundational questions about the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, potentially limiting presidential power. They argue that the political risks of such a move, especially with the public turning against aggressive ICE tactics, may be a significant deterrent for the administration.
