<li><b>Politico Playbook</b> reports that the Trump administration plans to shift the federal government away from directly recommending most childhood vaccines, aiming to align more closely with Denmark&rsquo;s immunization model which recommends fewer shots.

While the release focused heavily on former President Bill Clinton, a photo of Donald Trump was notably removed from the government website shortly after publication without explanation.
