    <div class="content"><h4>November 27, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that two National Guard members were shot and critically wounded near the White House. A suspect, a 29-year-old man from Afghanistan who entered the U.S. through a refugee program, is in custody. President Trump declared the shooting an "act of terror" and ordered 500 additional troops to Washington.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark analyzes the Trump administration's attempt to formulate a proposal regarding expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. The rollout has been stalled by internal GOP disagreements, specifically from House Speaker Mike Johnson, and complications regarding abortion coverage restrictions that could alienate necessary Democratic votes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Politico Playbook reports that the FBI is requesting interviews with six Democratic lawmakers regarding a video they filmed urging military troops not to follow illegal orders. Additionally, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced she will not seek a fourth term, and President Trump is showing signs of fatigue with a lighter public schedule.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark details how the U.S. military celebrates Thanksgiving, describing how dining facilities on bases worldwide transform into welcoming spaces where officers serve their subordinates.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State reports that City Council Member Julie Menin has declared victory in the race for City Council speaker, announcing she has secured the votes of 36 members. Additionally, Attorney General Letitia James is leading a lawsuit against the USDA regarding food stamps for refugees, and immigration arrests are becoming more common in the city.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Capitol Confidential outlines eight significant bills Governor Kathy Hochul must decide on by the end of the year, including the Medical Aid in Dying Act, the "100-ft. rule" regarding natural gas hookups, and the RAISE Act for AI regulation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York Playbook highlights that super PACs spent a record $34.4 million in the general mayoral election. The newsletter also notes that the City Council voted against appointing two prominent health care leaders to the Board of Health, citing the timing at the end of the current administration.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Slow Boring notes that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has rolled out a housing transition team that includes pro-supply advocates, such as Paul Williams from the Center for Public Enterprise and Annemarie Gray of Open New York.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Times Union reports that an investigation into the misuse of credentials by State Police members at the Ryder Cup has expanded to examine whether members were improperly given free passes for friends and family.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch reports that Israeli officials have identified the body of hostage Dror Or, who was murdered during the October 7 massacre. The newsletter also notes internal IDF memos indicating extensive manpower shortages.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jewish Currents covers a recent conference in Washington, D.C., organized by the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism. The event highlighted a fracture on the right, as the Task Force split from the Heritage Foundation following Heritage's defense of Tucker Carlson’s interview with Nick Fuentes.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Politico Playbook details a leaked transcript of a call between U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and a top Putin aide, in which Witkoff appeared to offer advice to the Kremlin on how to flatter President Trump. The leak has sparked concerns among Russia hawks in Congress.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that a fire in a high-rise complex in Hong Kong has killed at least 55 people. In Brazil, the Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to begin serving a 27-year sentence for a failed coup attempt.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Slow Boring analyzes climate politics in Australia, noting that while the right-wing party there faces pressure on climate issues, the current Labor government has not attempted to halt Australian coal mining or exports.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kottke.org shares a collection of links, including an article on *Chindōgu* (the Japanese art of "unuseless" inventions), a piece on how cars are becoming obsolete "bricks" due to software, and an essay on how social media monetization drives polarization.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Editors explores the history of Thanksgiving as a national holiday, tracing its origins not just to the Pilgrims, but to a 1777 resolution by the Continental Congress drafted by a committee including Samuel Adams.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Atlantic provides trivia for the holiday, debunking the myth that turkey meat is the primary cause of post-dinner sleepiness.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that Vahid Abedini, a professor at the University of Oklahoma, was detained by ICE for three days while traveling to an academic conference. Additionally, a UC-Berkeley protest of a Turning Point USA event has prompted two federal investigations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch highlights a study of Harvard students which found a significant number believe they should receive A's simply for working hard and completing homework, regardless of their understanding of the material.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Slow Boring discusses "missing heritability" in genetics, noting new evidence that suggests twin studies may have overestimated the heritability of traits compared to modern genome-wide association studies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times notes that seal milk is chemically more complex than human milk. Also, for those cooking today, the USDA says turkey is safe to consume at 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">David French writes in The New York Times that while the military reality in Ukraine may necessitate a cease-fire, any peace deal that sacrifices Ukraine's political independence or security against future Russian aggression would be a strategic disaster and a national shame for the United States.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Anne Applebaum argues in The Atlantic that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is prolonging the war in Ukraine by advising the Kremlin on how to manipulate President Trump and blocking aid, rather than pressuring Russia to stop its invasion.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonah Goldberg in The Dispatch warns that the political right has developed a "relativism problem," where an excessive form of "open-mindedness" allows conspiracy theories and falsehoods—such as Holocaust denial or the idea that the moon landing was faked—to be treated as valid perspectives under the guise of "just asking questions."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ross Barkan, writing in New York magazine (via City & State), opines that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will inevitably alienate some of his leftist supporters, noting existing tensions regarding City Council Member Chi Ossé.</p>
