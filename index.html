In a wide-ranging interview, President Trump rated the U.S. economy as an "A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus" despite polling showing voter frustration with costs. He also called European leaders "weak," suggested Ukraine must start "accepting things" regarding territory, and stated that any new Fed chair would be expected to cut interest rates immediately. Trump also noted that Nicolás Maduro's days as leader of Venezuela are "numbered" and did not rule out ground troops.

The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets this afternoon to decide on interest rates amid a confused economic picture. While wage and GDP growth appear healthy, job numbers are concerning—complicated by a lack of data due to the government shutdown—and inflation remains above the 2% target. Economists are debating whether the U.S. is seeing a "K-shaped" economy where the wealthy thrive while working-class households struggle with essentials.
