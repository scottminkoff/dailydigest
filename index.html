    <div class="content"><h4>November 17, 2025</h4><p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant reversal, President Donald Trump stated that House Republicans should vote to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, claiming "we have nothing to hide." The statement came ahead of a Tuesday vote on a bipartisan measure to release the documents, which Trump and GOP leadership had previously fought to block. The president also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate potential links between Epstein and prominent Democrats, including Bill Clinton. This follows the House Oversight Committee's release of 23,000 documents from the Epstein estate, in which, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, Trump is mentioned more frequently than any other individual named in his investigation order.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Federal Aviation Administration is lifting all restrictions on commercial flights at 40 major airports, ending the widespread cancellations and delays that occurred during the recent government shutdown. According to a CBS poll, a 55 percent majority of Americans believe Republicans won the shutdown standoff. The deal that ended the shutdown, however, has drawn criticism from various corners of the Democratic party.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration lifted tariffs on a wide range of imported food products, including beef, coffee, and fruit, in an effort to lower grocery prices. This move comes amid concerns about the rising cost of beef. In a separate trade development, the U.S. and Switzerland reached a deal to cut tariffs on Swiss imports, with Swiss companies pledging to invest $200 billion in the U.S. by 2028.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times investigation found that the Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, a shift that has undermined other law enforcement operations, including those targeting child predators, sex trafficking, and the black market for Iranian oil. The immigration crackdown has now expanded to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Border Patrol agents began arresting people over the weekend.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump indicated he is open to discussions with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and has "sort of" made a decision regarding potential U.S. military operations in the country. The comments come as the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, arrived in the Caribbean, part of what The Washington Post calls America's largest military presence in the region in decades.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, Pete Skandalakis, a longtime Georgia prosecutor, will take over the state's election interference case against Donald Trump, replacing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Additionally, a report from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics found that former Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August, violated the central bank's ethics code by making stock purchases. A federal bankruptcy court judge has also approved a settlement in which the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma, will contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years to resolve thousands of lawsuits related to OxyContin.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will require a top-level security clearance from the federal government, a process that will serve as an early test of his relationship with a hostile Trump administration. While Mamdani has no obvious triggers for denial, President Trump has previously used security clearances as a tool for retribution. Mamdani has indicated he is confident in his plan to retain NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch but has not made it official.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mamdani is also navigating a complex local political landscape two weeks into his transition. According to The New York Times, he has privately told City Council Member Alexa Avilés he would support outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander in a primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman, a move that has irked his allies in the NYC-DSA, which has endorsed Avilés.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul is preparing for her reelection bid and has called on Democrats to stop criticizing one another. Meanwhile, her administration is facing pressure to enact Mayor-elect Mamdani’s proposed tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy to fund programs like universal child care. Steven Fulop, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, called Mamdani's proposed corporate tax hike "absolute suicide" for the city's economy. Hundreds gathered at a rally in Union Square to demand Hochul support the plans.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the ongoing race for New York City Council speaker, the 17-member Brooklyn delegation is seeking to vote as a united bloc to increase its influence. The leading candidates, including Julie Menin and Crystal Hudson, are participating in a series of public forums this week. In other state news, the Gaming Facility Location Board is visiting the three remaining sites vying for a downstate casino license in the Bronx and Queens.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The US attorney's office in Albany will handle the defense for the Justice Department in a lawsuit filed by Maurene Comey. On Long Island, Republican Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman is reportedly considering a run for governor in 2026. Finally, a new super PAC backed by the artificial intelligence industry is launching a multimillion-dollar campaign against Assemblymember Alex Bores, targeting him over his sponsorship of the RAISE Act, a bill aimed at regulating AI.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-day trip to Israel, which has been billed as a solidarity and farewell visit. He is scheduled to meet with several top government officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, opting against a traditional state commission of inquiry. The decision comes after Israel's High Court of Justice stated there was "no real argument" against forming such a commission.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.N. Security Council is set to vote today on a U.S.-drafted resolution concerning Gaza that leaves open the possibility of Palestinian statehood. However, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated Israel's opposition to an independent Palestinian state. In a separate development, Axios reported that Israel is not opposed to a potential Saudi Arabian purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets, provided the deal includes normalization of relations between the two countries.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government is in turmoil, with his approval rating at -48 percent just over a year after a historic election victory. The Conservative Party has failed to capitalize on Labour's struggles, remaining similarly unpopular. Amid economic stagnation and widespread anger over immigration, the right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, is now polling at 29 percent, threatening to upend Britain's traditional two-party system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is working to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia and announced changes to "reboot" the country's energy sector amid corruption concerns from European allies. Meanwhile, Russia continues its attacks, striking Kharkiv and Kyiv, while Ukraine targets Russian energy infrastructure. Zelensky is currently in Paris seeking to purchase anti-missile systems.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Chile's presidential election is headed for a December runoff between Communist Party member Jeannette Jara, who received 26.8 percent of the vote, and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast, who finished with 24 percent. Both candidates have focused on tough-on-crime and anti-immigration platforms.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," produced with former USAID official Atul Gawande, highlights the human toll of the Trump administration's dismantling of U.S. foreign aid programs. According to a report in The Bulwark, one academic model estimates that the cuts have already led to 600,000 deaths, 400,000 of them children, from issues like severe malnutrition in refugee camps.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other global news, a Colombian government airstrike targeting a rebel group killed at least seven children. The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a peace deal with the M23 rebel group. The UK announced reforms to its asylum program, reducing the duration of refugee status from five years to 30 months. Japan has urged China to take "appropriate measures" after Beijing advised its citizens against traveling to the country.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The New York Times, patients are increasingly turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice. Many users cited long wait times, inattentive doctors, and high costs as reasons for seeking an alternative. While the bots often provide empathetic and accessible information, doctors expressed concern about their potential to give incomplete or fabricated answers in high-stakes medical situations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new super PAC backed by the artificial intelligence industry plans to spend millions to oppose New York Assemblymember Alex Bores' congressional campaign. Bores is the sponsor of the RAISE Act, state-level legislation that seeks to hold major AI developers accountable for potential "critical harm" caused by their technology. The tech industry is pushing for changes to align the New York bill more closely with a similar law recently passed in California.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ken Burns' new documentary series, "The American Revolution," debuted on PBS. The New York Times review notes that its treatment of slavery feels "urgent, necessary and maybe even risky."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system. The administration had threatened to cut millions in research grants and impose a $1.2 billion settlement over alleged discrimination and concerns of antisemitic civil rights violations at UCLA.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data shows that the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges began before the Trump presidency. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, foreign enrollment dropped by 7 percent last fall, driven by waning interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures for this year suggest the trend will worsen.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias argues that the Democratic senators who ended the government shutdown shouldn't be called "moderates." He contends that moderation is about aligning with public opinion on key issues, whereas their decision was about protecting federal workers and preserving Senate procedure, trading a political win against Trump for a less-bad short-term policy outcome. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">Read more.</a></p>
