    <div class="content"><h4>December 26, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Playbook (Dec 26)</b>: Democrats and the center-left think tank Third Way are strategizing for the 2026 midterms by focusing on the economy, specifically "affordability" and grocery costs. New polling suggests Democrats are gaining ground on cost-of-living concerns, though Republicans maintain leads on border security and national security. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is pushing tax cuts and a new housing proposal. Additionally, the administration is reportedly cutting billions from the "Housing First" homeless assistance program, sparking debate over the model's effectiveness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Playbook (Dec 25)</b>: The Trump administration is engaging in a dispute with Harvard University, with Education Secretary Linda McMahon implying a deal for the university to pay $200 million to the government, a term Harvard disputes. In immigration news, ICE is expanding its use of surveillance technology, including social media monitoring and facial recognition, while reducing privacy protections. Separately, the Justice Department announced it is reviewing "a million more" documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Argument</b>: The newsletter analyzes statistical variance in polling, specifically examining why a weighted sample of Hispanic voters might consistently lean further left than the actual electorate across multiple surveys. It discusses the industry practice of accepting sampling error versus investigating systematic skews.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Playbook (Dec 25)</b>: A proposed tax on short-term rentals in San Diego is shaping up to be a major political battle for 2026, with implications for housing affordability and the "gig" economy nationwide. On the international pressure front, the White House is instructing armed forces to focus on an oil "quarantine" of Venezuela to force economic concessions from the Maduro regime.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Slow Boring</b>: Expanded SNAP work requirements—which function effectively as reporting requirements—are being implemented by states following the "One Big Beautiful Bill." These changes include extending requirements to adults aged 55-64 and narrowing exemptions, which critics argue increases administrative burdens and reduces participation due to paperwork rather than actual work status.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Times Union</b>: The New York State Police faced a tumultuous year characterized by a leadership shakeup and the arrest of the former president of the troopers' union. In a separate legal development, a federal judge dismissed a Department of Justice lawsuit challenging New York’s Green Light Law, upholding the state's ability to issue driver’s licenses to nonresident immigrants.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Daily Freeman</b>: A winter storm warning has been issued for eastern and western Ulster County and western Greene County, with heavy snow accumulation expected. In local politics, Woodstock Supervisor-elect Anula Courtis is set to take office amidst town board tensions, and the Ulster Town Board is delaying a tax agreement with RUPCO pending a benefits statement.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Haaretz</b>: Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that Israel is implementing a policy of "de facto annexation" in the West Bank and suggested future settlements in northern Gaza, though he later claimed he had not backtracked on previous retractions. Concurrently, settler violence continues, with five suspects arrested after a stone-throwing attack wounded a Palestinian baby, and video surfacing of a reservist driving an ATV over a praying Palestinian man.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Argument</b>: An essay explores the cultural and historical evolution of Hanukkah in America, arguing that it was elevated and commercialized to serve as a competitor to Christmas despite being a minor religious holiday. The piece discusses the challenges of this adaptation, from repetitive rituals to the "Chinese food on Christmas" tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Haaretz</b>: The "Qatargate" affair is intensifying, with revelations that former Netanyahu aides referred to Qatar as "friends" in classified documents. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for a full investigation, stating that even if Netanyahu was unaware of his staff's actions, it represents a significant problem.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Playbook (Dec 26)</b>: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking an early meeting with President Trump, potentially at Mar-a-Lago, following a call with U.S. envoys regarding a peace plan.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>NYT Morning (Dec 26)</b>: In his Christmas address, Pope Leo called for peace and highlighted the plight of refugees and the poor. The address also touched on global conflicts, including the situation in Gaza.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Playbook (Dec 25)</b>: The island nation of Palau has agreed to accept up to 75 deportees from the U.S. who cannot be returned to their home countries. In exchange for serving as a "safe third country," Palau will receive $7.5 million and other benefits.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Slow Boring</b>: The newsletter highlights the underappreciated speed and power of recent AI model improvements. On the cultural front, it recommends Whit Stillman’s debut film, <i>Metropolitan</i>, as a holiday viewing tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Hudson Valley One</b>: A retrospective lists 100 venues that defined Ulster County culture in 2025, alongside a guide to 35 New Year's Eve events across the region, ranging from disco parties to rock concerts.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>NYT Morning (Dec 26)</b>: The Times presents its "Year in Pictures," featuring powerful photography from 2025, including images of wildfires in Los Angeles, political upheaval in Greenland, and daily life in war zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Playbook (Dec 26)</b>: Food manufacturers are pushing back against HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s "MAHA" agenda, arguing that banning ingredients will raise grocery prices. Simultaneously, the American Academy of Pediatrics has sued HHS, alleging political retaliation via grant cuts for criticizing Kennedy’s vaccine stances.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Times Union</b>: A parent is preparing to sue a school district after allegations that their child was held in a "timeout" box, raising questions about disciplinary practices in schools.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Daily Freeman</b>: A quick response by a groundskeeper and a sheriff's deputy prevented an apartment fire in High Falls from spreading, saving the property from significant destruction.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Dispatch</b>: Kevin D. Williamson meditates on the story of the Magi, contrasting the cold perfection of the star with the vulnerable reality of the child in Bethlehem. He explores the tension between divine distance and intimate presence, noting the terrifying implication of the gifts that foretold death.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Slow Boring</b>: Caroline argues that the success of Feeding America’s auction system lies in its ability to let local food banks signal their specific needs, a flexibility that is being undermined in federal nutrition programs by new, rigid work reporting requirements that reduce participation through administrative burden.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Substack Notes</b>: Jonathan V. Last, Lakshya Jain, and Matthew Yglesias discuss public indifference to low unemployment and the implications of "slopulist" rhetoric in polling questions.</p></div>
