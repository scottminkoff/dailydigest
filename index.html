Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny following a report that he ordered a lethal follow-up strike on survivors of a suspected drug-trafficking boat in the Caribbean. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have launched bipartisan inquiries into the incident to determine if the orders violated laws of war. President Trump, while stating he would not have wanted a second strike, noted he needs to "find out" what happened, while Hegseth has dismissed the reporting as fabricated.</p>
