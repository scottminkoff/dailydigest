The Senate advanced a war powers resolution in a rare bipartisan rebuke of President Trump, aiming to require congressional approval for further military action in Venezuela. Five Republicans joined Democrats in the 52-47 procedural vote, signaling significant unease on Capitol Hill regarding the administration's long-term plans to control the South American nation. Senator Susan Collins, one of the defectors, specifically cited her disagreement with the idea of the U.S. "running" Venezuela as a motivating factor for her vote.

Tensions are escalating in Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. While the Trump administration has characterized Good as a "domestic terrorist" who attempted to run over the agent, a visual analysis suggests the officer was out of harm's way when he fired the final shots. Minnesota state officials have now withdrawn from the investigation, stating that the FBI has denied them access to critical evidence and case materials.

In a wide-ranging interview, President Trump asserted a view of executive power largely unconstrained by international law, stating that only his own morality and mind limit his actions. He confirmed plans to maintain U.S. oversight of Venezuela for years and reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland, believing ownership offers strategic advantages that treaties cannot match. The president also revealed plans for physical changes to the White House, including a new ballroom and a second level to the West Wing colonnade.

A federal judge has ruled that the appointment of acting U.S. Attorney John A. Sarcone III was unlawful and has quashed subpoenas his office issued to New York Attorney General Letitia James. The ruling disqualifies Sarcone from further involvement in prosecuting or supervising the criminal investigations that prompted the subpoenas. This decision comes amidst reports that federal prosecutors are investigating financial transactions involving James and her longtime hairdresser.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul and NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced a unified plan to significantly expand free and low-cost child care across the state. The proposal aims to put New York City on track to become the first city in the U.S. to provide free universal child care. This collaboration marks a significant alignment between the Governor and the newly elected, democratic socialist mayor on a key affordability issue.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Bruce Blakeman is facing skepticism from his party's conservative base regarding his stances on abortion and gun rights. Right-leaning activists are circulating petitions against his nomination, and the state NRA affiliate is investigating his record on firearms. This internal friction complicates his path to challenging Governor Hochul in a state where Republicans already face a significant registration disadvantage.

Israel's Construction and Housing Ministry has issued a bid for the construction of 3,401 housing units in the controversial E1 area east of Jerusalem. This construction plan, delayed for years due to international pressure, would effectively bisect the West Bank and is widely seen as damaging the prospects for a future contiguous Palestinian state. The move is expected to draw sharp criticism from the international community.

President Trump is scheduled to meet with top oil executives at the White House to discuss plans to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure following the capture of Nicolás Maduro. While Trump claims companies are ready to invest $100 billion, major oil firms like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips remain skeptical due to political instability and past expropriations. The administration has indicated it expects to control Venezuelan oil for "much longer" than a year, using it as a lever for broader geopolitical goals.

A new study suggests that the widely discussed "male loneliness crisis" is actually a broader youth loneliness crisis that significantly impacts young women. Data from three national surveys indicate that young people of both genders are increasingly anxious and socially disengaged, with young women reporting higher rates of social isolation than their male counterparts. This challenges the prevailing narrative that antisocial attitudes are a uniquely male phenomenon.

Despite the visible success of robotaxis like Waymo, the autonomous vehicle industry faces skepticism regarding its scalability and true independence from human operators. Critics argue that Waymo still relies heavily on a large workforce to monitor and assist its vehicles, suggesting self-driving technology is not yet a "solved problem." The fact that only Waymo and Tesla are actively pursuing this technology at scale, without a broader investment frenzy, raises further questions about its immediate economic viability.

Scientists have discovered that some dogs are "canine prodigies" capable of learning and remembering the names of dozens or even hundreds of objects. One Border collie named Basket knows the names of at least 150 toys and can retrieve them on command, learning many through eavesdropping similar to how human toddlers acquire language. This research suggests that while most dogs know basic commands, a select group possesses a much deeper capacity for vocabulary.

SUNY has revised a proposed rule regarding the selection of community college leadership, now limiting its scope to temporary appointments rather than permanent presidents. The original proposal, which would have given the SUNY chancellor more oversight over local hiring decisions, faced pushback during the public comment period. The new rule allows local boards to appoint an "administrator-in-charge" for up to one year to prevent leadership gaps, subject to SUNY Board of Trustees approval.

Cyberattacks against higher education institutions are proliferating due to the valuable intellectual property and open-research environments found on campuses. Universities are facing increased threats from nation-state actors targeting critical infrastructure and research collaborations. A coming forum will discuss how R1 universities can better protect themselves while maintaining their academic missions.

Jollibee, the fast-growing Filipino fast-food chain, is challenging American giants with its unique menu items like Chickenjoy and sweet spaghetti. The chain's strategy involves serving food that appears typical to American palates but offers distinct flavor profiles that have garnered a cult following. It represents a significant cultural export and business success story for the Philippines in the competitive U.S. market.

<h4><b>Opinion</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Jonathan V. Last argues that the disparate reactions to the killings of Renee Good and Ashli Babbitt reveal a fascist worldview within the American right, where violence is judged not by law but by whether it serves the regime. He contends that the administration’s lies about Good—claiming self-defense despite video evidence—signal to federal agents that they can kill political "undesirables" with impunity. This dynamic, Last asserts, is not hypocrisy but a coherent illiberal ideology where the in-group is protected and the out-group is targeted.

John McWhorter suggests that the open use of the F-word by the Trump administration, specifically in the acronym FAFO, signals a linguistic maturity where society moves past "antimacassar notions about the body." While criticizing the specific context of using the term regarding the Venezuela operation, McWhorter argues that shedding the stigma around profanity allows for more honest communication. He contrasts the fading taboo of the F-word with the rising stigma of racial slurs, which he views as a positive shift toward resisting tribal hatred rather than denying physical reality.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Eric Hayot and Matt Seybold argue that the "crisis of the humanities" has ended, but only because the entire university system is now under the same political and technological siege that once targeted only the liberal arts. They contend that the distinction between the humanities and other disciplines has collapsed as metrics, efficiency, and political scrutiny now threaten all of higher education equally. The authors suggest this shared vulnerability means all academics must now defend the university's core mission together, rather than viewing the humanities as a uniquely endangered silo.
