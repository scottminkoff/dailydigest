<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
A new Department of Homeland Security report confirms that two federal officers fired their weapons at Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, contradicting initial claims that he was brandishing a gun at the time of the fatal shooting. The killing has sparked a political firestorm in Washington, with House Democrats threatening to impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Senate Republicans signaling they may not support funding the agency without reforms. Amidst the backlash, the Trump administration has removed Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino from his post in Minnesota and replaced him with "border czar" Tom Homan to oversee operations.

Representative Ilhan Omar was attacked at a town hall in Minneapolis by a man who sprayed her with an unknown substance from a syringe while she was speaking against ICE. President Trump dismissed the severity of the incident, stating he hadn't seen the video but suggesting she "probably had herself sprayed," a comment that stands in stark contrast to typical bipartisan condemnations of political violence. Omar was physically unharmed in the attack, and the suspect was immediately tackled by security and arrested.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
New data indicates that the "affordability crisis" plaguing American voters is driven less by the daily cost of goods like gas and food, and more by the rising "price of entry" for a middle-class life, such as housing, childcare, and healthcare. A NYT/Siena poll found that 51% of voters cite these major structural costs as their primary worry, compared to just 23% who cite monthly bills. This disconnect explains why economic dissatisfaction persists despite stabilizing inflation, as high interest rates intended to curb inflation actually exacerbate costs for housing and loans.

Preliminary data shows a significant drop in violent crime across the United States in 2025, with homicides in 35 major cities falling by 21 percent compared to the previous year. Philadelphia specifically reported its lowest number of homicides since 1966, while nationwide drug overdose deaths have decreased by roughly 35 percent from their 2023 peak. Experts attribute the decline to a combination of community violence prevention programs, recovered police morale, and a potential "supply shock" in the fentanyl trade.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
New York State is projected to lose two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives following the 2030 census due to stagnant population growth relative to other states. While the state's population technically increased by just over 1,000 people last year, it remains down by more than 200,000 since 2020, ranking 45th in the nation for growth. This stagnation threatens to further diminish New York's political influence in Washington.

A federal judge has appointed Nicholas Deml, the former commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections, as the new remediation manager for Rikers Island. Deml will possess broad authority to overhaul the jail's operations, including restructuring the workforce and changing policies, bypassing some of the city's traditional oversight. The appointment marks a significant escalation in federal intervention after the city failed to address persistent dangerous conditions at the complex.

Amtrak has agreed to restore full Empire Service train schedules between New York City and Albany by early March, resolving service cuts that had frustrated commuters and legislators. Governor Kathy Hochul announced that as part of this resolution, a proposal to extend Metro-North service to Albany has been shelved for the time being. The restoration follows significant pressure on Amtrak after they reduced trips due to infrastructure issues.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide to Eric Adams, of accepting diamond earrings as a bribe in exchange for pressuring city officials to approve real estate projects. The new court filings allege Lewis-Martin pushed for the approvals despite safety concerns raised by Department of Buildings officials. These accusations are part of a broader indictment against Lewis-Martin involving bribery, money laundering, and conspiracy.

A U.S. official states that the Biden administration believes Hamas disarmament in Gaza will likely include "some sort of amnesty" for the group's members. However, Hamas is reportedly demanding that 10,000 of its police officers be incorporated into the new U.S.-backed Palestinian administration for Gaza, a condition Israel has previously rejected. A Hamas source told Reuters that disarming without a role in security would be a "recipe for anarchy and slaughter."

Spain is moving to legalize hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, a policy starkly at odds with the tightening restrictions seen elsewhere in Europe and the United States. The measure, driven by the need for labor to support the country's economy and social security system, will allow migrants to apply for renewable residency permits. Opposition parties have criticized the move, claiming it accelerates an "invasion."

The CIA is reportedly working to establish a permanent presence in Venezuela, with plans to influence U.S. operations on the ground both in the short and long term. While the State Department will lead diplomatic efforts, the CIA is expected to set up an annex to support operations before an official embassy is opened. This comes as the U.S. faces legal challenges regarding military strikes on drug trafficking vessels in the region.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has blamed the FAA for a 2025 midair collision in Washington, D.C. that killed 67 people, citing the agency's approval of a dangerous flight path for a military helicopter. The investigation found that the approval introduced "unacceptable risk" by routing the helicopter through airspace used by commercial planes. The board also noted failures in pilot training and overworked air traffic controllers as contributing factors.

A feud is brewing in Iowa between private colleges and community colleges over legislation that would allow public two-year institutions to offer bachelor's degrees. Private colleges view the move as an existential threat to their enrollment and business models.

<h4><b>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
A study of "corporate power" as a political catchphrase argues that the term is too vague to be useful for policy analysis or measurement. While used as a shibboleth to signal progressive bona fides, it lacks the empirical rigor found in debates over issues like climate change or inequality, where metrics are debated but defined. The piece suggests that because the entire economy is composed of corporations, rallying against "corporate power" without specificity is analytically fruitless.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The Trump administration's partial retreat on immigration enforcement in Minneapolis following the shooting of Alex Pretti shows that even "fascist" movements can be constrained by public backlash and political realities. However, true accountability requires legal consequences for agents who break the law and officials who issue unlawful orders, not just personnel shuffles. The goal of such accountability is not revenge, but to deter future administrations from believing they can execute illegal orders with impunity.

Donald Trump is losing support among the working-class voters who were instrumental in his 2024 victory, particularly those making less than $25,000 a year. Focus groups with voters who switched from Biden to Trump reveal deep dissatisfaction with the chaos of his second term, specifically the "brutality" of immigration enforcement and the lack of economic improvement. This "buyer's remorse" suggests his coalition is fraying faster than anticipated.
