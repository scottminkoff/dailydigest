<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">U.S. national security leaders inadvertently included a journalist in a Signal group chat detailing upcoming military strikes in Yemen, exposing a significant lapse in operational security regarding sensitive war plans. This breach underscores the chaotic communication protocols within the administration, as officials coordinated kinetic military actions on commercial messaging platforms rather than secure government channels. The recipient of the messages noted the surreal nature of the disclosure, stating, "I didn’t think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nearly a year into his second term, President Trump’s administration has deported approximately 600,000 unauthorized immigrants, a figure that falls well short of his campaign promise to remove one million people annually. While the White House touts historically low border crossings as a success, conservative allies are criticizing the operational inefficiency of focusing primarily on violent criminals rather than a broader dragnet. A DHS official defended the record, stating, "In record time, we have totally secured the border and are carrying out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens in history."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A rapidly growing Christian movement known as the New Apostolic Reformation is increasingly influencing the Republican party with a theology that seeks to dismantle the secular state. This movement, which views political battles as spiritual warfare, has moved from the fringes to become a central pillar of support for the current administration's agenda. The reporting indicates that tens of millions of American Christians are embracing this charismatic movement, which explicitly aims to "destroy the secular state."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York State Regional Economic Development Council has awarded significant grants to bolster infrastructure in the Hudson Valley, specifically targeting sewer projects in New Paltz and Ellenville. These funds are critical for enabling local development, including a 15-unit affordable housing cooperative at the Elizabeth Manor Boarding House site, addressing both sanitation and housing needs. The initiative is part of a broader $463 million state program designed to spur economic growth and infrastructure modernization across the region.</p>

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The UN Security Council has scheduled an emergency session to address Israel's decision to recognize the independence of Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia. This diplomatic move has sparked international controversy, with reports suggesting Israel and the U.S. explored using the territory for the resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza. The session highlights the growing geopolitical friction as Israel seeks unconventional alliances in East Africa.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Eli Feldstein, a former spokesman for Prime Minister Netanyahu, has testified to investigators that a senior official in the Prime Minister's Office offered to "silence" an IDF investigation into the leak of classified documents. Feldstein identified the official as Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman, alleging that Netanyahu was fully aware of the leak to foreign press and "stood behind" the operation. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett described the revelations as showing the PMO was "operated... by the Arab-Islamist terrorist state of Qatar, using tainted money."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Hamas is preparing to elect a new political bureau chief to replace Yahya Sinwar, with Gaza-based leader Khalil al-Hayya and former chief Khaled Meshal emerging as the frontrunners. The election, expected to take place within the group's Shura Council in the coming weeks, will determine the organization's strategic direction regarding the ongoing conflict and potential ceasefire negotiations. This leadership change comes as the group faces pressure to either disarm and accept a new governing power or risk prolonging the war.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United States conducted airstrikes in Nigeria targeting suspected Islamic State militants, a move framed by the Trump administration as a defense of persecuted Christians. While the action averted a unilateral Nigerian military intervention, security experts warn that the strikes may not hinder the militants and could drag the U.S. into a complex, long-running local conflict. Nigerian officials have expressed concern that these strikes could provoke coordinated retaliatory attacks in the region.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Scientists believe they may have detected starlight from the very first generation of stars, known as Population III, using the James Webb Space Telescope. These stars, which shone more than 13 billion years ago, were identified via gravitational lensing in an ancient galaxy called LAP1-B. The discovery confirms key theoretical predictions about the metal-poor composition of the universe's earliest celestial bodies.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">American society is experiencing a profound shift toward isolation, with citizens spending more time alone than ever before in history. This rise in solitude is reshaping national politics, individual personalities, and the collective grasp on reality, creating what is being termed "The Anti-Social Century." The cultural analysis suggests that this disconnection is not just a social preference but a structural change with deep psychological and civic implications.</p>

<h4><b>HIGHER EDUCATION</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new analysis argues that American education is sliding toward illiteracy due to steadily declining standards and lowered expectations for students. The report suggests that a systemic failure to enforce rigorous academic benchmarks is resulting in a generation that is less equipped to read, think critically, and engage with complex ideas. This trend poses a long-term threat not just to individual economic prospects, but to the civic health of the nation.</p>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Timothy W. Ryback argues that the dismantling of German democracy in 1933 provides a chilling historical blueprint, noting that Hitler destroyed the system in just 53 days using the constitution itself. Ryback details how legal mechanisms were manipulated to consolidate authoritarian power, warning that democratic institutions are more fragile than they appear when tested by bad-faith actors. The piece serves as a cautionary tale about the speed with which established norms can collapse under pressure.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonathan Rauch posits that a single word—"corruption"—best describes Donald Trump's approach to governance and his worldview. Drawing on the work of sociologist Max Weber, Rauch argues that Trump operates through a lens of patrimonialism, where personal loyalty and transactional relationships supersede the rule of law and institutional integrity. He suggests this perspective explains Trump's actions more accurately than traditional political labels like "conservative" or "populist."</p>
