<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Federal agents shot and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, in Minneapolis during a confrontation that has sparked widespread protests and allegations of government overreach. While the administration labeled Pretti a "domestic terrorist," video evidence reviewed by the press suggests he was holding a phone rather than a gun and was pepper-sprayed before being shot. The <em>Atlantic</em> argues this incident sends a chilling message that "masked federal agents can commit murder simply because an American citizen exercising their Second Amendment rights scares them."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A severe winter storm affecting half the country has disrupted congressional schedules and raised concerns about the passage of government funding bills to avert a partial shutdown. Democrats are reportedly worried that President Trump may withhold federal disaster aid from blue states in the storm's aftermath, though the White House dismisses these concerns. <em>Politico</em> notes that "the timeline looks increasingly tight for Congress to clear government funding bills" given the weather delays.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Supreme Court will soon hear arguments regarding President Trump's executive order that attempts to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens born on U.S. soil. This case challenges 125 years of settled legal precedent and hinges on the administration's reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment's jurisdiction clause. If upheld, "hundreds of thousands of babies born in the United States each year would be denied citizenship," creating a massive administrative and human rights crisis.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has released a new National Defense Strategy that shifts focus away from China to prioritize threats in the Western Hemisphere and narcotics trafficking. This document marks a significant departure from previous administrations by calling for deterrence "through strength, not confrontation" regarding Beijing. The strategy directs the Defense Department to "maintain a favorable balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific" while emphasizing border security.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has ordered the NYPD to cut back on overtime, a move that aligns with his campaign promise to eliminate the department's overtime budget entirely. This directive has sparked concern among rank-and-file officers regarding future operational capacity. The <em>New York Post</em> reports this is "what the rank and file fear is just the beginning" of tighter fiscal constraints on the department.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is preparing for a significant winter storm expected to dump at least 10 inches of snow on New York City, though officials insist the transit network will remain operational. MTA Chair Janno Lieber expressed confidence in the agency's preparedness, stating, "This is not our first rodeo." The storm preparations come as early voting opens for four special elections for legislative seats.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ulster County is bracing for a massive winter storm that could bring up to 24 inches of snow between Sunday morning and midday Monday. In response to the forecast, Dutchess County Executive Sue Serino has declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban effective from early Sunday. The storm is expected to bring "frigid Arctic air" but no significant ice accumulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The IDF reported killing several Palestinians who crossed the "Yellow Line" separating Hamas-run territory from the IDF buffer zone in northern Gaza. Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are expected in Israel to advance President Trump's Gaza plan, which may involve an international stabilization force. The family of Ran Gvili, the last hostage held in Gaza, insists Israel must not succumb to pressure to open crossings without the return of his remains.</p>

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos without securing a deal to acquire Greenland, following unified opposition from European leaders. The diplomatic spat included threats of tariffs on European nations, which were eventually withdrawn after Europe suspended a trade deal and deployed symbolic troops to the island. Despite the setback, Trump touted a "framework of a deal" regarding sovereignty over U.S. military bases in the territory.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned nine vessels in a "shadow fleet" accused of transporting prohibited Iranian oil as part of a pressure campaign against Tehran's crackdown on protesters. Simultaneously, Washington has warned Iraqi officials to exclude Iranian-backed groups from their government or face potential limits on oil revenue access. This marks the first time the U.S. has threatened Iraq's oil revenue in this manner.</p>

This behavior challenges long-held assumptions about livestock intelligence, showing "versatility, anticipation, and fine motor targeting."

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Archaeologists have discovered hand stencils on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi dating back 68,000 years, making them the oldest known rock art in the world. This find predates previous records by thousands of years and suggests early humans were creating art long before migrating to Australia. The discovery supports the view that Sulawesi hosted a "vibrant and longstanding artistic culture."</p>
