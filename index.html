The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis, reversing its prior stance as political pressure mounts. This federal probe comes amidst a chaotic crackdown in the region that also saw the arrest of independent journalist Don Lemon for reporting on a related church protest. Administration officials initially defended the agents, but Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino has since been relieved of his duties in the area and replaced by Tom Homan, who brought "a pledge to reduce the number of agents in the area."

In a move characterized by critics as a politicized law enforcement escalation, the FBI executed a search warrant at an elections hub in Fulton County, Georgia, seeking ballots from the 2020 election. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly accompanied agents during the raid, raising significant legal and ethical questions about the involvement of intelligence officials in domestic law enforcement. Senator Mark Warner stated that Gabbard is either violating the law regarding intelligence oversight or "injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt."

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
President Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor and Morgan Stanley banker, to succeed Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. The selection of an establishment figure rather than a disruptor suggests Trump was persuaded that "having someone who deeply understands the Fed was needed to change the Fed," despite his frequent attacks on the institution's independence. However, confirmation faces a hurdle as retiring GOP Senator Thom Tillis has vowed to block nominees until the DOJ investigation into Powell is resolved.

The Justice Department released a massive tranche of more than three million files, videos, and images related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, fulfilling a congressional mandate. The documents shed further light on Epstein’s relationships with high-profile figures, including Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, and current Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche pushed back against accusations of delay, stating, "I take umbrage at the suggestion... that the attorney general or this department does not take child exploitation or sex trafficking seriously."

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed the "Local Cops, Local Crimes Act" to ban local law enforcement agencies from entering into 287(g) agreements that deputize them to assist federal immigration authorities. This move is a strategic pivot to differentiate herself from Republican challenger Bruce Blakeman, whose Nassau County administration actively cooperates with ICE. Hochul emphasized that federal agencies have sufficient funding, stating, "You will not weaponize local police officers against their own communities in the state of New York."

The death toll from the recent winter storm and freezing temperatures in New York City has risen to 13, intensifying scrutiny on Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s handling of the crisis. The fatalities are adding political pressure as the Mayor also navigates a contentious budget battle with Governor Hochul over a projected $12 billion shortfall. Sources indicate Hochul views Mamdani's warnings about the budget gap as an "underhanded ploy to push his socialist dreams."

Israel has announced that the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt will reopen on Sunday to allow transit in both directions. While pitched as a reopening, movement remains restricted to Gaza residents who left during the war and specific humanitarian cases involving the sick and wounded. An Israeli security official estimates that "between 150 and 200 entries and exits are expected at the crossing per day."

Diplomatic relations between Israel and South Africa have deteriorated further, with both nations declaring the other's diplomats <em>persona non grata</em>. South Africa expelled Israel's chargé d'affaires citing violations of diplomatic norms, prompting Israel to retaliate by ordering South Africa's ambassador to Palestine to leave within 72 hours. This exchange underscores the deep rift caused by South Africa's prominent role in challenging Israel's conduct in Gaza at the international level.

The United Nations is facing an imminent financial collapse and may run out of money by July if member states, particularly the United States, do not pay their dues. The funding crisis threatens the organization's operational capacity at a time of significant global instability.

Amazon’s new documentary "Melania" is facing skepticism over its massive $75 million budget for rights and marketing, which far exceeds norms for the genre. Industry observers question the financial logic, with some suggesting the exorbitant spending is an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with the Trump administration rather than a sound commercial investment. The film is tracking for a dismal opening weekend of $2 to $5 million, though Amazon maintains it has "inestimable value for its cultural impact."

Paleontologists have discovered an exceptionally preserved 512-million-year-old ecosystem in China's Huayuan County, revealing soft tissues like guts and nervous systems that rarely fossilize. The site dates back to the Cambrian period and contains 153 species, over half of which are new to science. The findings suggest that ancient species were able to disperse widely across the superocean, potentially using "floating rafts" to travel between what is now China and Canada.

The Trump administration is seeking to join a federal lawsuit against UCLA's medical school, alleging the institution uses a "systemically racist approach" in its admissions process. The Department of Justice claims the school illegally balances its class racial demographics in violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and the recent Supreme Court ban on affirmative action. This move signals the administration's intent to aggressively enforce a colorblind legal standard in higher education.

President Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the IRS and the Department of Justice over the leak of his tax returns, alleging the government failed to protect his private information. While the legal basis for the suit is considered plausible due to federal statutes protecting taxpayer data, the scenario of a sitting president suing the executive branch he controls is unprecedented. Trump openly acknowledged the conflict of interest, noting, "I’m the one that makes the decision... and it’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself."

Financial markets have shown surprising resilience in early 2026, largely shrugging off geopolitical shocks like the US seizure of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro and investigations into the Federal Reserve Chair. Analysts suggest that strong economic fundamentals and a perception that Trump often retreats from his most extreme threats (the "TACO" theory) have helped investors tolerate chaos. However, Trump's recent threats of a "massive armada" against Iran and ongoing tariff battles continue to test this market stability.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The traditional definitions of "left" and "right" in American politics are becoming less useful as right-wing populists increasingly embrace economic interventionism previously associated with the left. Jonah Goldberg argues that while the right may use the state to favor different groups or ends, the shared willingness to use government power to order society suggests that "‘right’ and ‘left’ just seem like different labels for very similar products." He warns that the "identitarian" turn on the right is a betrayal of the American creed, mirroring the identity politics they once opposed.

The recent FBI raid on the Fulton County election office is a chilling sign that the Trump administration intends to weaponize federal law enforcement to interfere with future elections. Nick Catoggio argues that postliberalism's "ruthless" prioritization of outcomes over process means the administration will use pretexts—like hunting for 2020 fraud—to seize control of election machinery ahead of the midterms. He warns that losing control of the federal government is viewed by the MAGA right as an "irreparable calamity" that justifies any means to prevent it.

Civil society and state governments must prepare immediate legal and social responses to potential federal interference in the upcoming elections, as the Trump administration has signaled a willingness to use law enforcement for political ends.
