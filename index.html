        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House Rules Committee has advanced a government funding package without changes, setting up a procedural vote today to end the partial shutdown. While House Speaker Mike Johnson believes he has the votes to pass the measure, which funds most agencies through September but limits DHS funding until mid-February, he can only afford to lose a single Republican vote given the slim majority. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has warned that attempts by hardliners to attach the SAVE Act to the package would make the bill "dead on arrival" in the Senate.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New reporting reveals that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was personally requested by President Trump to oversee an FBI search of a Georgia elections office regarding the 2020 election. During the operation, Gabbard reportedly placed Trump on speakerphone with agents, allowing him to ask questions about the investigation directly. This unusual intervention by a president and a DNI in a specific law enforcement action could provide ammunition for future legal defenses should charges arise.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has announced "Project Vault," a new initiative to amass a $12 billion stockpile of critical minerals for civilian use. The project, funded largely by a loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, aims to counteract China's dominance in the supply chain for materials essential to EVs and semiconductors. Major corporations including Google, General Motors, and Boeing have agreed to join the initiative.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Kathy Hochul has seen a significant boost in her polling numbers, now leading potential Democratic primary challenger Antonio Delgado by 53 points and Republican Bruce Blakeman by 26 points. In a recent interview, Hochul indicated she would support a standalone omnibus bill to enact immigrant protections, such as banning local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, rather than waiting for the state budget. She also confirmed her intention to seek a third term if reelected in November, despite previously supporting term limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Frontline Democratic congressional candidates Tom Suozzi, Laura Gillen, and Josh Riley have amassed substantial war chests for their reelection bids, with Suozzi reporting $4.5 million cash on hand. While Democrats are capitalizing on Trump's low popularity in the state, vulnerable Republican incumbents like Mike Lawler are also posting strong fundraising numbers. The financial disparity is starkest in upstate New York, where Riley has 12 times the cash of his GOP challenger.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">At least 16 people have been found dead outdoors in New York City amidst a prolonged freezing spell that has kept temperatures at or below freezing for 11 consecutive days. Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s administration has deployed "warming buses," but reports indicate significant confusion, with people at key locations like the Staten Island Ferry Terminal unaware of their presence. The fatalities highlight the severe impact of the weather crisis on the city's homeless population.</p>

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt has reopened for limited pedestrian traffic, marking a symbolic step in the cease-fire agreement required by the Trump administration's peace plan. While this provides a potential lifeline for medical treatment, logistics remain complicated with multiple security layers involving Egyptian, Israeli, European, and Palestinian officers. Approximately 50 Palestinians are expected to cross in each direction initially.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A senior Israeli military official has acknowledged that the IDF's estimate of approximately 70,000 Gazan deaths during the war aligns with figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. While the IDF claims at least 22,000 of those killed were combatants, the health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters. This admission contrasts with previous Israeli dismissals of the ministry's casualty counts.</p>

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump announced a finalized trade deal with India following a call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which includes lowering U.S. tariffs to 18 percent in exchange for India eliminating trade barriers. Trump claimed India also committed to stopping purchases of Russian oil, though Modi's subsequent statement did not mention this specific concession. This agreement comes shortly after India signed a free trade agreement with the European Union.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump is hosting Colombian President Gustavo Petro at the White House today, just a month after a U.S. operation seized Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. Despite previous hostilities where Trump called Petro a "lunatic," the relationship has thawed following Petro's cooperation on drug trafficking issues. The meeting is seen as high-stakes given Petro's unpredictable nature and past criticisms of U.S. policy.</p>

<h4><b>CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has announced that the Kennedy Center will close for two years starting July 4th for a "complete rebuilding," following a hostile takeover of its leadership. This move comes after Trump failed to attract top talent to the venue and struggled with ticket sales under his appointed leadership. Critics view the closure as an admission of defeat regarding his attempt to impose a "MAGA makeover" on the cultural institution.</p>

<h4><b>HIGHER EDUCATION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has reportedly dropped his administration's demand that Harvard University pay $200 million to resolve conflicts, though he later posted on social media that he is now seeking $1 billion. This erratic negotiation tactic highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and elite higher education institutions. The initial backtracking was seen as an attempt to resolve long-standing administrative conflicts.</p>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The welfare fraud scandal in Minnesota, often blamed on Somali immigrants, is actually a structural failure of outsourcing government services to private middlemen. Policy analyst Matt Bruenig argues that privatizing welfare administration creates inherent incentives for fraud regardless of the provider's background. He suggests the focus should be on the flawed "middleman" policy structure rather than immigration status.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A provocative essay examines the argument that liberals should arm themselves and form militias in response to an increasingly hostile federal government. Drawing parallels to the Bundy standoff, the author notes that armed groups are often treated with more caution and professionalism by law enforcement than unarmed protesters. However, the piece ultimately questions whether this is the correct moral path for the current opposition movement.</p>
