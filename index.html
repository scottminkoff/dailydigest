<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Governor Kathy Hochul recently appeared on “Inside City Hall” to discuss her working relationship with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, specifically pushing back against his calls to increase taxes on the state's wealthiest residents. While Hochul’s 30-day budget amendments were largely technical, her office has indicated that adjustments to the state’s climate law remain a possibility during ongoing negotiations. Additionally, the state budget is set to provide significant relief to Western New York, with the City of Buffalo slated to receive $40 million in direct state aid to help close its budget deficit. Meanwhile, the political landscape is shifting in the legislature as longtime Assembly Member Bill Magnarelli faces a Democratic primary challenge from Onondaga County Legislator Maurice Brown, and Long Island Assembly Member David McDonough announced he will not seek reelection.

Amid rising tensions with Iran and the potential for a U.S. attack, U.S. Representative Pat Ryan is advocating for legislation to limit President Donald Trump's authority to unilaterally wage war. Ryan, an Iraq War veteran representing the 18th Congressional District, argues that the War Powers Resolution is essential to check executive overreach in military conflicts. In a separate legislative push at the state level, Senator Michelle Hinchey has introduced a bill aimed at criminalizing dangerous conduct by corporate executives that results in widespread damage or injury. These moves highlight a dual focus among Hudson Valley officials on accountability for both federal executive power and corporate governance.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
A controversial proposal to convert a warehouse in Chester, Orange County, into an immigration detention facility has reportedly been halted. The property, owned by a former adviser to Donald Trump, had faced significant local scrutiny before Assembly Member Brian Maher announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would stop pursuing the site. This development marks a significant victory for local opponents who had mobilized against the establishment of the detention center in their community.

The Ulster County Resource Recovery Agency is advancing plans for a new reuse facility designed to divert 5,000 tons of waste annually from landfills. The agency is currently negotiating with Brooklyn-based Big Reuse to operate the facility in the Town of Ulster. Separately, the controversial Pike Plan canopies in Uptown Kingston have been nearly completely demolished, with only small sections remaining, marking a significant visual change for the historic district.

<h4><b>New York City Government and Politics</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Tensions are escalating between Mayor Zohran Mamdani and City Council Speaker Julie Menin over public safety resourcing. Menin has publicly criticized Mamdani's decision to freeze hiring for the NYPD, warning that the police force has shrunk to levels comparable to the period immediately following 9/11. This dispute underscores the broader ideological rift in city leadership as Mamdani pushes a progressive budget agenda that includes property tax hikes if state-level wealth taxes are not enacted.

A federal monitor has issued a scathing report on the NYPD, concluding that the department continues to engage in unconstitutional policing practices. The report highlights unlawful stops of residents and a systemic underreporting of stop-and-frisk tactics. Monitor Mylan Denerstein pointed to a lack of meaningful accountability within the department as a core issue, fueling ongoing debates about police reform in the city.

In a legislative move impacting the business sector, democratic socialist lawmakers in Albany are seeking to expand tenant protections to commercial renters in New York City. Building on recent successes in strengthening residential rent stabilization and passing "good cause" eviction laws, this new push aims to regulate the commercial rental market. Simultaneously, an affordable housing development in Mott Haven, the Bronx, has become the first project to utilize a new voter-approved fast-track review process intended to speed up housing construction.
