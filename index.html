<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Politico Playbook PM</strong> reports that the Pentagon inspector general found Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth risked endangering troops by using the messaging app Signal to discuss strike plans, though he did not violate rules on classified information because he asserted his authority to declassify the data. Meanwhile, Admiral Frank Bradley briefed lawmakers on the Venezuela boat strikes, with Republicans largely defending the actions and Democrats calling them "troubling."<br>
