        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Republicans in Utah are launching an aggressive campaign to repeal a 2018 anti-gerrymandering ballot measure, aiming to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2028 cycle. If successful, this effort could lead to the state having four different congressional maps within an eight-year span, positioning the GOP to control redistricting before the state likely gains a seat in 2030. The repeal effort is currently backed by significant national Republican funding but has gathered only 15 percent of required signatures as the deadline approaches.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Supreme Court has issued an interim decision blocking the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops in Illinois, maintaining a lower court order while litigation proceeds. The administration had attempted to mobilize forces in the Chicago area in October, but state and city officials challenged the move, arguing the federal government lacked the authority to execute laws in the state using the military. Justices Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch dissented from the decision.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has reportedly intensified a militarized campaign against Venezuela involving oil, drug interdiction, and immigration enforcement. President Trump claimed the U.S. destroyed "a big facility" in Venezuela, believed to be a drug trafficking site, marking the first known attack on Venezuelan soil since the pressure campaign began.

The strategy for the upcoming legislative session focuses on repealing the "100-foot rule" to save ratepayers money and directing regulators to prioritize affordability alongside climate goals. This legislative push comes as the state grapples with high energy prices and the transition to renewable sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kingston lawmakers are poised to override Mayor Steve Noble’s veto of a resolution that would continue rent control under the Emergency Tenant Protection Act. Alderwoman Michele Hirsch stated the Common Council has the necessary six votes to reverse the veto, which followed a unanimous vote to extend the protections.

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Matthew Yglesias argues against the "Billionaire Derangement Syndrome" prevalent in modern political discourse, suggesting that attributing all societal ills to the wealthy is intellectually unhealthy. He points out that not all billionaires are vocal political actors, citing figures like Bruce Kovner who hold moderate views and support civic institutions. Yglesias concludes that while tax policy debates are valid, vilifying business success itself is counterproductive.</p>
