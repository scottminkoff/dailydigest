Governor Kathy Hochul released her 30-day budget amendments, proposing an increase in spending by over $2 billion compared to her January executive proposal. The amendments include significant adjustments such as a tripling of temporary municipal assistance to $150 million to aid localities facing fiscal cliffs, as well as specific aid for Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, and Yonkers. Notably, Hochul removed a controversial policy proposal that would have authorized the expansion of autonomous vehicle pilot programs upstate, a move applauded by labor unions representing for-hire drivers.

A state appellate court unanimously rejected a Republican bid to block the redrawing of New York’s 11th Congressional District, currently held by GOP Representative Nicole Malliotakis. The ruling clears the way for the Independent Redistricting Commission to begin drafting new lines, potentially altering the political landscape for the upcoming midterm elections. While state-level appeals were denied fast-tracking, Republicans have filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court, with final briefs due this evening.

State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins has assembled a working group to develop legislation limiting information sharing between state, local, and federal immigration enforcement. This move comes as the Department of Motor Vehicles announced it will discontinue issuing driver's licenses to "non-domiciled" applicants following federal funding threats, marking a significant policy shift. Concurrently, a new bill has been introduced that would require federal ICE agents to identify themselves and display badges during operations in New York.

The Bard College Board of Trustees has retained the law firm WilmerHale to conduct an independent review of the relationship between college president Leon Botstein and Jeffrey Epstein. This follows reports of significant financial ties and communications between the two, which the board aims to investigate to maintain institutional integrity. The review comes as Botstein faces scrutiny for his fundraising methods, despite being credited with saving the institution from financial ruin in previous decades.

A New York State Police investigator based in Poughkeepsie was fired after pleading guilty to federal charges of lying to investigators regarding a narcotics case. The investigator, Michael O’Flaherty, admitted to tipping off a confidential informant about a probe into the sale of fentanyl pills linked to overdose deaths in Dutchess County. This case highlights ongoing accountability efforts within the State Police amidst the broader opioid crisis affecting the Hudson Valley region.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Mayor Zohran Mamdani is facing intense pushback from New York City’s congressional delegation over his proposal to hike property tax rates by 9.5 percent. During a tense meeting at City Hall, lawmakers like Rep. Gregory Meeks warned that the increase would disproportionately harm middle-class homeowners and minority communities. Mamdani argues the hike is necessary to close a projected budget deficit unless the state legislature authorizes taxes on the wealthy, setting up a high-stakes standoff with Albany.

Following the ethos of his predecessor, Mayor Mamdani has proposed budget cuts that would force reductions in service hours at city libraries, drawing criticism from advocates. Simultaneously, the administration plans to close the city's last emergency migrant shelter by the end of the year, signaling a shift in the city's crisis response strategy. These austerity measures seem at odds with his progressive platform, highlighting the fiscal constraints facing City Hall.

A Manhattan appeals court has halted NYCHA’s controversial plan to demolish and replace 2,000 units of public housing at the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses. The ruling puts a pause on one of the housing authority’s most ambitious redevelopment projects, which had faced opposition from tenants and housing advocates. This decision complicates the city's broader efforts to modernize its aging public housing stock through privatization and demolition strategies.

Matthew Yglesias analyzes Mayor Mamdani’s governance style, noting that his political charisma allows him to make pragmatic, often moderate decisions without losing his progressive base. Yglesias points to Mamdani's reappointment of NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch and constructive relationships with establishment figures as evidence of this dynamic. The analysis suggests Mamdani is navigating municipal realities by occasionally undercutting left-wing challengers to secure cooperation from state and federal leaders.
