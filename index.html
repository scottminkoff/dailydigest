    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A major intraparty feud has erupted between former President Donald Trump and one of his staunchest congressional allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. The split centers on Greene's recent push for the full release of the Justice Department's files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which she reiterated she would continue. In a Truth Social post, Trump called Greene a "ranting lunatic" and a "traitor," which Greene told CNN was "hurtful" and could put her life in danger. She said she still supports Trump but wishes he would focus more on cost-of-living issues. Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump on "Fox News Sunday," stating the former president is not worried about the files and is frustrated they are being turned into a political issue.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on legislation from Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna that would force the release of all Epstein records. Massie said he hopes for a "veto-proof majority." In related news, Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to lead a new investigation into Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats. Newly released documents also show that Epstein exchanged texts with Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a congressional hearing.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has transformed the Department of Homeland Security to focus on its deportation campaign, a New York Times investigation found. Thousands of federal agents have been diverted from other duties, such as combating terrorism financing, human smuggling, sex trafficking, and child exploitation, to arrest undocumented immigrants. This shift has resulted in a federal immigration crackdown in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Border Patrol agents made numerous arrests over the weekend. The agency's next target is reportedly New Orleans. As part of the deportation agenda, the administration is also exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In economic news, the government will release the delayed September jobs report on Thursday. The administration also rolled back tariffs on some agricultural products like beef, coffee, and bananas, a move that could help alleviate high grocery prices. Separately, new disclosures show that Donald Trump has purchased at least $82 million in bonds since late August. Financial disclosures also revealed that the surprise departure of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler in August came as she was under investigation for violating ethics rules by trading individual stocks.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, funding for the SNAP program, or food stamps, is flowing again. However, other programs like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program could take weeks to reopen. In Washington, some moderate House Republicans are pushing for a deal to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies to avoid premium hikes. According to a new CBS poll, Americans believe Republicans won the shutdown by a margin of 55 percent to 6 percent.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump Organization is reportedly in talks for a Trump-branded property within a major Saudi Arabian government-owned real estate development. The project is overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Trump is scheduled to host in Washington next week.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Other political news includes turmoil at the Heritage Foundation, where President Kevin Roberts has defended Tucker Carlson's decision to host white nationalist Nick Fuentes on his show, sparking outrage from some staffers. Separately, Trump announced he has pardoned two more people for crimes related to the January 6 Capitol insurrection.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the ongoing race for New York City Council speaker, the 17-member Brooklyn delegation, led by party leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, is attempting to unite as a single voting bloc to increase its influence. According to City & State, the move is an effort to avoid being sidelined as it has been in past speaker races. Top candidates for the position include Julie Menin, who has support from Queens, and Crystal Hudson, a favorite among progressives.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A judge has ordered New York City to temporarily halt any new agreement over the use of the Citi Field parking lot with Mets owner Steve Cohen. The ruling could potentially torpedo Cohen's bid to bring a casino to the Queens location.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to detain immigrants, which would expand federal detention capacity in the city. The use of New York county jails by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already surged this year as part of the administration's broader deportation agenda.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the government shutdown, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are now reaching the nearly 3 million New Yorkers who rely on them after what officials called a "nail-biting scramble." However, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), which helps with winter heating bills, could take weeks to reopen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other state and city news, officials at Brooklyn Hospital Center are warning that the facility could be forced to shut down by the end of the year without aid from Governor Kathy Hochul. Conservationists are also pressing Hochul to approve a ban on harvesting horseshoe crabs. A federal judge has dismissed a Trump administration lawsuit against the city of Rochester over its sanctuary city policy.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to former USAID official and writer Dr. Atul Gawande, the Trump administration's dismantling of U.S. foreign aid has led to devastating consequences. In an interview with The Bulwark, Gawande stated that the halt to global assistance has already resulted in an estimated 600,000 deaths, including 400,000 children. A new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," highlights the human toll, focusing on a Sudanese refugee in Kenya whose daughter is suffering from severe malnutrition due to the aid cuts. Gawande called the policy a "cruel, senseless" assault on global cooperation that has also dismantled pandemic prevention networks.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly weighing military options in Venezuela. A classified Department of Justice brief, justifying boat strikes in the Caribbean, described fentanyl not only as a drug threat but also as a potential chemical weapons threat. Meanwhile, President Nicolás Maduro was seen singing John Lennon's "Imagine" at a rally protesting the U.S. pressure campaign.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the Middle East, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is planning a meeting with a chief Hamas negotiator as the administration monitors the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, where many remain displaced without running water or electricity. Top administration officials are also reportedly planning to meet with former President Trump to persuade him not to restart nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Ukraine, Russia has continued its assault on Kyiv with drones and missiles, killing at least six people. The attacks have recently targeted the country's power grid as winter approaches. A New York Times photojournalist has documented the obliteration of the eastern city of Pokrovsk, which Russia has been fighting to control for over a year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Elsewhere, the BBC is facing a crisis after editing a speech by Donald Trump, prompting seven days of silence from the broadcaster. Trump has said he plans to sue the BBC for as much as $5 billion over the edits.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The cable news channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW on Saturday morning. The change, part of a reported $20 million effort, was occasioned by parent company Versant spinning out from NBC Universal. In an interview with POLITICO, hosts said that despite a changing media landscape and declining viewership for cable news, the channel remains a place that makes news.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The New York Times, patients are increasingly turning to A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT for medical information. A survey found one in six adults consults bots for medical advice, citing long wait times and inattentive doctors in the traditional system. Users find the chatbots to be empathetic and accessible, though doctors worry about the potential for incomplete or inaccurate answers to high-stakes health questions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant scientific development, researchers have sequenced RNA from the 39,000-year-old remains of a woolly mammoth. As reported by 404 Media, this is by far the oldest RNA ever sequenced, pushing the timeline back by 25,000 years. The study also revealed that the famous mammoth mummy, named Yuka, was male, not female as previously believed.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In film, director Guillermo del Toro's adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" is now streaming on Netflix. According to a review in The Atlantic, while the production is handsome and compassionate, it feels somewhat inert. Looking ahead, The New York Times has a list of 65 movies to see this winter.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Leonids meteor shower is expected to reach its peak tonight. A mostly dark moon will provide favorable viewing conditions. In other news, Olivia Nuzzi has written a new book about the scandal involving her digital relationship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that upended her journalism career.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Dispatch, Jonah Goldberg analyzes the recent turmoil at the Heritage Foundation, where its president defended Tucker Carlson for platforming white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Goldberg writes that this reflects a broader identity crisis on the right, as postliberal and nationalist factions that enabled Trump's rise now contribute to the mainstreaming of figures like Fuentes. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in his New York Times newsletter, Jamelle Bouie argues that Vice President JD Vance is "groyper adjacent" due to his failure to condemn Nick Fuentes and his own use of anti-immigrant demagoguery. Bouie contends there is little practical difference between Vance's nativist rhetoric and Fuentes's vision of a white ethno-state. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Michelle Cottle argues that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries' fatal flaw is that he is too smooth, reasonable, and benign to be a compelling opposition figure against Donald Trump, at a time when Democrats need a "wartime consigliere." <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">For The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn interviews Dr. Atul Gawande, who calls the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID and other global assistance programs a cruel and senseless policy. Gawande argues the cuts are causing "public man-made death" on a large scale and represent an assault on the idea of cooperation to solve global problems. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch hosted a debate on the future of the Senate filibuster. John McCormack argued that eliminating the 60-vote threshold would lead to instability and remove incentives for bipartisanship, while Andrew Egger contended that the filibuster no longer produces good outcomes and only weakens an already impotent Congress. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/">https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Jean Twenge writes that to improve student test scores and mental health, schools should ban not only smartphones but also laptops and tablets from the classroom, arguing that the educational benefits are outweighed by the distractions. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/schools-laptops-tablets-ban.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/schools-laptops-tablets-ban.html</a></p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge ruled late Friday that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally fine the University of California system or cut its federal funding over claims of antisemitism and discrimination.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The SUNY Board of Trustees took the unprecedented step of formally voting down the nomination of Maria Conzatti to become the next president of Nassau Community College, escalating a leadership fight that has lasted for more than three years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a recent podcast, The Dispatch interviewed William Inboden, a professor at the University of Florida, for an episode titled "Save Our Universities!" discussing the state of higher education.</p>
