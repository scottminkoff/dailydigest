<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>POLITICO Playbook</b><br>President Trump defended Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a Cabinet meeting, praising him despite reports that Hegseth ordered a "kill everybody" directive during a strike on a drug-trafficking vessel. Hegseth defended the strikes as necessary to combat "narco terrorists." Congressional committees are slated to receive briefings on the incident this week. Meanwhile, the White House is considering expanding its travel ban to nearly 30 countries following a shooting of National Guard soldiers in D.C. by an Afghan national. Additionally, a new immigration enforcement operation targeting undocumented Somali immigrants is launching in Minneapolis.<ul><li><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/01/james-comey-letitia-james-cases-next-00672339">POLITICO: DOJ weighs seeking new indictments against James Comey and Letitia James</a></li></ul></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The New York Times</b><br>President Trump issued a pardon for former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in the U.S. of a vast drug-trafficking conspiracy. The move contradicts the administration’s escalating military campaign against drug trafficking in the region. Additionally, a federal appeals court ruled that Alina Habba, appointed by Trump as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, was holding the position unlawfully.<ul><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/nyregion/alina-habba-unlawful.html">The New York Times: Appeals Court Rules Alina Habba Appointment Unlawful</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/nyregion/immigration-judges-fired-trump.html">The New York Times: Trump Administration Fires Eight Immigration Judges in NYC</a></li></ul></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>POLITICO Playbook PM</b><br>A closely watched special election is taking place today in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, viewed as a national test for both parties. While Republican Matt Van Epps is expected to win, the margin of victory in the deep-red district is under scrutiny. Separately, the Justice Department is reportedly considering seeking new indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York AG Letitia James after a judge tossed previous cases due to an improper appointment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Dispatch</b><br>Legal experts suggest Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and military personnel could face criminal liability if reports are true that a second strike was ordered specifically to kill survivors of a boat attack. The administration maintains the operations were lawful. In other news, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recommended a full travel ban on countries "flooding" the U.S. with criminals.<ul><li><a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/afghan-vetting-process-explained/">The Dispatch: What Does Afghan Vetting Actually Look Like?</a></li></ul></p>
