    <div class="content"><h4>November 20, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Congress has overwhelmingly passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which directs the Justice Department to release all unclassified files related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The House approved the measure by a vote of 427-1, and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent. President Trump, who initially lobbied against the bill but reversed course over the weekend, signed the legislation into law. However, the bill contains provisions allowing the Attorney General to withhold information that could identify victims or impair federal investigations. In a related development, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries forcefully denied Republican accusations—specifically from Rep. James Comer—that he had solicited campaign funds from Epstein in 2013, calling Comer a "stone-cold liar."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the federal case against former FBI Director James Comey, prosecutors admitted to a judge that the full grand jury did not see the final indictment before it was approved. During a hearing described as "excruciatingly awkward," U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff grilled prosecutors, including Trump-appointed attorney Lindsey Halligan, about the irregularity. The defense is arguing that the procedural errors, along with the alleged political motivation behind the charges, are grounds for dismissal. Additionally, it was revealed that the Justice Department instructed prosecutors not to disclose the existence of a memo from career prosecutors recommending against charging Comey.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House, celebrating a new agreement for the U.S. to sell F-35 fighter jets to the kingdom and cooperating on civil nuclear energy. During the visit, President Trump dismissed questions regarding the U.S. intelligence assessment that the Crown Prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, stating that "things happen." The visit concluded with a lavish state dinner attended by tech executives, including Elon Musk and Tim Cook.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is moving to dismantle the Department of Education by outsourcing several of its key offices and grant-making programs to other federal agencies, including the Department of Labor. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit dropped nearly 24 percent in August, driven largely by a decline in imports following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs. However, the release of the October jobs report has been canceled due to the recent federal government shutdown, though September data is expected to be released today.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will meet with President Donald Trump at the White House tomorrow. The meeting comes despite Mamdani running a campaign highly critical of the President; Mamdani stated he intends to discuss affordability and public safety. In a move surprising both supporters and critics, Mamdani announced that current Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch will remain in her post. Despite their ideological differences—Mamdani is a democratic socialist who has supported defunding the police, while Tisch advocates for more officers—both pledged to work together on public safety.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Internal tensions within the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) were on display as Mamdani attended a forum to urge the group <i>not</i> to endorse City Council Member Chi Ossé’s primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Mamdani argued that the movement should focus on delivering for New York City rather than engaging in a potentially divisive federal primary.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">At the state level, Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration announced the closure of the Bare Hill Correctional Facility in the North Country due to staffing shortages, a move criticized by Republicans. Additionally, Representative Elise Stefanik and Governor Hochul’s campaign traded barbs over reproductive rights after Stefanik co-sponsored a bill providing tax credits for IVF, despite previous comments expressing opposition to the procedure. Stefanik claimed she misspoke in the prior interview.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Israel launched a series of airstrikes in Gaza, killing at least 25 people according to local health officials. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the strikes were a response to Hamas breaking a six-week-old ceasefire by firing on troops. In a separate incident, an Israeli airstrike on the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp in Lebanon reportedly killed 13 people; Israel claimed it targeted a Hamas military compound, while Hamas denied having installations there.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the United States, the Orthodox Christian Church is seeing a surge in attendance from young conservative men drawn to the faith's strict requirements and traditional structure. While this report focuses on Christian Orthodoxy, the trend parallels similar movements within religious traditionalism.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The White House has reportedly drafted a 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, developed in consultation with Russia. The proposal would require Ukraine to cede territory currently under its control and limit its military size in exchange for security guarantees. Reports indicate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not interested in the current proposal. Meanwhile, Ukraine used U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time since restrictions were lifted.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has reportedly signed off on CIA plans for covert operations inside Venezuela, while simultaneously reopening back-channel communications with the Maduro government. Separately, voters in Ecuador rejected a proposal to host U.S. troops, a blow to the country's Trump-allied president. In Nigeria, an investigation revealed widespread lead poisoning in the town of Ogijo caused by battery recycling factories supplying global supply chains.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nvidia reported soaring profits for another quarter, with revenue hitting $57 billion, driven by insatiable demand for its AI chips. The company's market value has reached $4.5 trillion. In legal news, a federal judge ruled in favor of Meta in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, stating that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp did not constitute illegal monopolization.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the art world, a portrait by Gustav Klimt sold for over $236 million, becoming the second most expensive painting ever sold at auction. The deaths of philanthropists Leonard Lauder and Agnes Gund this year have highlighted a crisis in funding for New York cultural institutions. Finally, the highly anticipated film adaptation of "Wicked" opens in theaters tonight.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The University of Arkansas has received a request from a state legislative office for course materials and syllabi related to Middle East studies, raising concerns among faculty about academic freedom. On a national level, newly released documents show that former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is stepping down from the board of OpenAI after emails revealed correspondence between him and Jeffrey Epstein regarding research funding.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new survey of immigrants in the United States reveals a complex picture: while half report feeling less safe under the current administration's crackdown, roughly 70% say they would still choose to migrate to the U.S., and 80% believe they are achieving the American dream. Meanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza are increasingly turning to cryptocurrency as a means of survival due to the collapse of the formal banking system and the physical destruction of cash.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">David French in <i>The New York Times</i> argues that the incompetence of the Trump administration's legal team—highlighted by the botched handling of the James Comey indictment and the Texas gerrymandering case—is inadvertently serving as a check on its worst authoritarian impulses.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Katherine J. Wu in <i>The Atlantic</i> critiques the "Make America Healthy Again" movement's dismissal of germ theory, arguing that while improved nutrition is beneficial, relying on "natural immunity" without vaccines is a dangerous public health strategy that ignores the biological reality of pathogens.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonah Goldberg in <i>The Dispatch</i> contends that today's Republican Party is echoing the "me-too Republicanism" of Richard Nixon—prioritizing power and populist resentment over conservative ideology—and notes that some on the "New Right" are openly embracing Nixon as their model.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonathan V. Last in <i>The Bulwark</i> suggests that President Trump's power may have already peaked, citing pushback from Republicans on the Epstein files and the filibuster, as well as polling data indicating a potential Democratic resurgence in the midterms.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Robert L. Friedman in <i>The Editors</i> criticizes the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for hosting a panel that he argues presented a biased and demonizing view of Israel's actions in Gaza, prioritizing political activism over public health analysis.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jesse Singal on his Substack criticizes the "culture of casual calumny" in modern journalism, using a recent newsletter by Taylor Lorenz as a case study of how reporters prioritize signaling ideological virtue and attacking reputations over charitable interpretation and fact-finding.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonathan Cohn in <i>The Bulwark</i> analyzes Republican proposals to replace Affordable Care Act subsidies with health savings accounts or direct cash, arguing that evidence shows "shopping" for healthcare leads to patients skipping necessary care rather than lowering system costs.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mary Speck in <i>The Dispatch</i> argues that a U.S. military campaign against drug boats in the Caribbean is unlikely to stem the flow of narcotics or topple the Venezuelan regime, and may instead empower cartels.</p>
