<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The White House is restructuring Department of Homeland Security operations in Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to oversee the situation while Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino reportedly departs. President Trump signaled a potential de-escalation by noting a "very good call" with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, though his press secretary continued to blame Democratic leadership for the violence. Meanwhile, investigators are reviewing body camera footage of the shooting as congressional Democrats push for the impeachment of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Congressional Republicans are looking to revive the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship to register for federal elections. The push includes proposed amendments that would impose a national photo ID requirement for voting, a measure Senate Democrats have vowed to block. Additionally, a federal court recently struck down Virginia's felony disenfranchisement policy, ruling it violated the Virginia Readmission Act of 1870.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A severe winter storm has swept across the United States, leaving millions facing perilous temperatures and resulting in at least 25 weather-related deaths, including eight in New York City. The storm caused widespread power outages and the cancellation of over 15,000 flights, with hazardous conditions expected to persist through the week due to a surge of Arctic air. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that air travel is expected to return to normal operations by Wednesday.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Justice Department under the Biden administration reportedly opened an investigation into Representative Ilhan Omar in 2024 to scrutinize her finances and potential interactions with a foreign citizen. The inquiry, which examined whether she benefitted financially from her husband's business dealings, appears to have stalled due to a lack of evidence. Trump recently announced that the DOJ is investigating Omar regarding her increased wealth.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Kathy Hochul is set to hold a major rally with influential labor unions, including the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council and 1199SEIU, as she gears up for her reelection campaign. This show of force comes as she faces pressure from the left on tax policy and prepares for potential conflicts with the Trump administration over immigration enforcement. The rally aims to solidify her support base ahead of the state Democratic convention in February.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York Representative Tom Suozzi has publicly apologized for voting in favor of a Department of Homeland Security funding bill, stating he failed to view the vote as a referendum on the conduct of ICE agents in Minneapolis. This reversal aligns him with other Democrats, including Rep. Laura Gillen, who are now calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment. The shift reflects growing intra-party tension regarding federal funding for immigration enforcement agencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Republicans have appealed a judge’s decision to throw out the congressional map for New York City’s only GOP-controlled House seat, a move that could impact the battle for control of Congress. The appeal seeks to preserve the current district lines against a challenge that claims they were unconstitutionally drawn. This legal battle adds another layer of uncertainty to the state's political landscape ahead of the upcoming elections.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has approved an operating plan that dedicates 62% of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative investments to affordability programs. If auction proceeds exceed projections, a portion of the surplus will be used to directly reduce ratepayer collections for customers of the Department of Public Service and the Long Island Power Authority. This strategy aims to balance clean energy goals with the need to lower energy bills for New York residents.</p>

While he has received praise for his visible leadership during the crisis, the city is struggling to get homeless individuals into shelters, with at least eight weather-related deaths reported. Mamdani also announced he will not accept a salary increase during his first term, despite authorizing a commission to study pay raises for other elected officials.</p>

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The IDF has recovered the remains of Ran Gvili, the last missing Israeli hostage in Gaza, from a mass grave in Gaza City, meaning no Israeli hostages remain in the strip for the first time since 2014. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that following this recovery, the war's focus will shift to the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza rather than immediate reconstruction. Concurrently, Israel announced a limited reopening of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt for the passage of people.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Documentation by an Israeli researcher reveals that excess soil from construction sites in Tel Aviv is being used to expand settlements in the West Bank. This unauthorized disposal bypasses the IDF authority responsible for administering the territory and is partly driven by a lack of regulated dump sites within Israel. The practice facilitates land preparation for settlement growth without formal oversight.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Burma's military junta has claimed victory in a widely criticized multi-round election where opposition candidates were excluded and voting sites were limited. The military, which seized power in a 2021 coup, automatically retains 25% of legislative seats, while seats in rebel-controlled areas remain unfilled. Reports indicate the junta is using "ghost ships" to evade sanctions and import fuel for military operations against rebels.</p>

<h4><b>CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New research reveals that human ancestors were creating tools much earlier than previously believed, with a 500,000-year-old bone hammer and 430,000-year-old wooden tools discovered in Europe. These artifacts predate modern humans and were likely crafted by early Neanderthals or a predecessor species. The findings significantly push back the timeline for sophisticated tool-making capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">There is a resurgence of interest in Depression glass, the mass-produced, colored glassware from the 1930s that was often given away as promotional items. Collectors are particularly drawn to uranium glass, which glows under ultraviolet light, and the unique, whimsical colors that contrast with modern neutral aesthetics. The author argues that using these vintage glasses enhances the experience of consuming treats like root beer floats.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Anthropic has released "Claude's Constitution," a document outlining the ethical framework it uses to train its AI models to balance usefulness, safety, and respect for users. The framework attempts to navigate contradictory user demands, such as avoiding harm while not being a "humorless scold," by providing explicit instructions on how to handle ethical trade-offs. The author argues that transparency about these values is critical to preventing AI from becoming a tool that merely pays lip service to ethics while prioritizing corporate profits.</p>

<h4><b>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A consumer shares a detailed grievance about a new flannel shirt that features mismatching button thread color on the bottom button. The author notes that while the shirt fits perfectly, the orange thread on the bottom button clashes with the grey thread used elsewhere, which is a problem since he wears the shirt untucked. This seemingly small detail serves as a jumping-off point for a discussion on design choices and manufacturing oddities.</p>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jesse Singal argues that the Trump administration's "culture of impunity" following the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents is eroding the moral case for nonviolent protest. He contends that by lying about the victims and obstructing investigations, the administration is destroying the checks and balances that distinguish a democracy from a dictatorship. While maintaining that violent resistance remains a strategic error, Singal suggests it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell activists they have a legitimate path to justice within the current system.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Matthew Yglesias revisits Eisenhower's handling of the 1956 Suez Crisis as a historical parallel to current geopolitical strategies, noting that while Ike successfully forced a British and French withdrawal, the move ultimately failed to align Egypt with the West. He uses this to question the long-term efficacy of dramatic interventions that achieve short-term tactical wins but lose the broader strategic game. The piece explores the "what if" scenario of a more passive U.S. approach during that pivotal moment in Middle Eastern history.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonathan Rauch argues that the term "fascism" is now the accurate descriptor for Donald Trump’s governing style, citing his creation of a paramilitary police force and ostentatious violation of rights. He contends that reluctance to use the word has become perverse given the totality of Trump's actions, which go beyond mere corruption or populism. The piece calls for the disbanding of ICE and the impeachment of those responsible for recent extrajudicial killings.</p>
