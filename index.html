<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell regarding building renovations, a move that has sparked significant backlash from Senate Republicans and economic officials. Senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski have criticized the probe as coercive, with Tillis threatening to block future nominees, while former Fed chairs issued a joint statement warning against undermining the central bank's independence. Powell responded with a video statement asserting that the threat of charges is a consequence of the Fed refusing to follow President Trump's preferences on interest rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona has filed a lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Department of Defense to prevent the Pentagon from degrading his military rank or reducing his retirement pay. The lawsuit follows Hegseth's initiation of proceedings against Kelly in response to comments the Senator made urging service members not to follow unlawful orders. Legal experts suggest the demotion attempt is likely to fail in court, though the Defense Department has yet to issue a public comment on the filing.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United States and Taiwan are nearing a trade agreement that would reduce tariffs on Taiwanese imports and expand semiconductor investment in the U.S. Under the proposed deal, the Trump administration would lower tariffs on Taiwanese goods from 20 percent to 15 percent in exchange for TSMC investing an additional $165 billion in American chip production. Taiwan’s Office of Trade Negotiations confirmed that a general consensus has been reached, though the Chinese government has condemned the move.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Kathy Hochul is set to deliver her State of the State address, where she will unveil a legislative package focused on affordability and counteracting federal policies. Key proposals include requiring judicial warrants for civil immigration enforcement in sensitive locations, protecting student loan borrowers from wage garnishment, and providing direct payments to farmers affected by tariffs. Hochul is also expected to announce a plan to ensure every child in New York has access to free school meals, even during the summer months.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York City Council staff member was detained by ICE agents while making a routine court appearance in Bethpage, prompting outrage from city officials. Council Speaker Julie Menin and Rep. Dan Goldman are demanding the staffer's release, with Menin noting this appears to be the first time a Council employee has been detained in this manner. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani condemned the detention as an "assault on our democracy."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A proposed ICE processing facility in the Hudson Valley is reportedly slated for a warehouse owned by Carl Icahn, a former adviser to Donald Trump. The facility in the village of Chester would process between 500 and 1,500 immigrants at a time before transferring them to larger detention centers. This development comes as local opposition mounts against the expansion of immigration enforcement infrastructure in the region.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Official U.S. documents reveal that Washington may finance a new Israeli factory for armored vehicles with up to $2 billion from military aid funds. This potential funding comes shortly after Prime Minister Netanyahu stated an aim to taper off U.S. military aid over the next decade. While the U.S. Army stated no formal decision has been made, the project highlights the continued deep military industrial cooperation between the two nations.</p>

She stated the government is violating a High Court of Justice ruling requiring a draft plan under existing law. This legal clash intensifies the internal political conflict regarding burden-sharing in Israeli society.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Protests in Iran have entered their third week, with human rights groups reporting 646 deaths and over 10,000 arrests since demonstrations began in late December. The unrest, triggered by the plunging currency and inflation, has spread to at least 185 cities across all 31 provinces. While the Iranian government has signaled openness to "fair" negotiations, it also stated it is "prepared for war" amid threats of U.S. intervention.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has stated he is inclined to block Exxon Mobil from drilling in Venezuela, criticizing the company's CEO for calling the country "uninvestable." This comment follows the U.S. seizure of Nicolás Maduro and signals a potential shift toward the U.S. government taking a direct stake in Venezuelan oil assets. The administration is reportedly looking to control revenue streams directly rather than relying on private American corporations.</p>

<h4><b>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">U.S. greenhouse gas emissions rose by 2.4 percent in 2025, marking an increase after two years of decline. This rise coincided with a 2.4 percent increase in nationwide energy demand, highlighting the continued link between economic activity and carbon output.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonathan V. Last argues that Donald Trump's "domination theory"—the idea that might makes right—is now being applied to domestic politics just as it is to foreign policy. He suggests that the Trump administration sees laws, whether international or the U.S. Constitution, as binding only if one chooses to believe in them, citing the Minneapolis mayor's admission that local police cannot practically stop federal agents due to being outgunned. Last warns this signals a shift toward a "law of the jungle" domestically.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Matthew Yglesias contends that while increased spending on the elderly through Social Security and Medicare is politically popular, it crowds out funding for other priorities like fertility and poverty reduction. He notes that this trend has been bipartisan and largely undiscussed, despite structurally changing the federal budget. Yglesias argues that if society wants to prioritize the elderly, it should be an explicit choice rather than an automatic drift.</p>
