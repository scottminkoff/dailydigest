    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A major intra-party fissure has opened between former President Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his staunchest congressional allies. The public split centers on Greene's persistent calls to release the Justice Department's files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has responded with scathing social media posts, calling Greene a "traitor," a "ranting lunatic," and a RINO, and signaling he would support a primary challenger against her. In an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Greene said Trump's comments were "hurtful" and could "radicalize people against me and put my life in danger." She maintained her support for Trump's agenda but vowed to continue pushing for the files' release.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Amid the fallout, House Republican leadership plans to hold a vote on Tuesday on a bill from Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) that would force the full release of the Epstein records. Massie predicted a "deluge" of Republican support for the measure. The controversy has deepened as newly released documents show Epstein exchanged texts with Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands and cast aspersions on Trump, claiming to have photos of him "with girls in bikinis in my kitchen." In response to the releases, Trump demanded an investigation into Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, and Attorney General Pam Bondi has assigned Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to lead the probe.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times investigation found that the Department of Homeland Security has been transformed to prioritize President Trump's deportation campaign, diverting thousands of agents from their normal duties. This shift has reportedly undermined a wide range of other law enforcement operations, including a national security probe into Iranian oil financing terrorism, as well as federal efforts to combat human smuggling, sex trafficking, and child exploitation. As part of the intensified immigration crackdown, Border Patrol agents have commenced an operation dubbed "Charlotte's Web" in Charlotte, N.C., making numerous arrests. The agency's next target is reportedly New Orleans, in an operation to be called "Catahoula Crunch."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The government shutdown's effects continue to unwind. Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is flowing again, ending a period of food hoarding and uncertainty for millions. The Department of Transportation is also easing flight cuts at 40 major airports due to improved air traffic controller staffing. In Congress, some moderate House Republicans are pushing for a deal to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent premium hikes, with some members floating a bill that would redirect subsidies directly to individuals.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, the Trump Organization is reportedly in talks for a Trump-branded property within a major Saudi Arabian government-owned real estate development. The discussions come as Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Washington next week. On the economic front, the delayed September jobs report is now scheduled for release on Thursday. President Trump also issued an executive order rolling back his "reciprocal" tariffs on some agricultural imports like beef, coffee, and bananas, a move that could help alleviate high grocery prices.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the lead-up to the New York City Council speaker race, Brooklyn Democratic Party leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is attempting to unify the borough's 17-member council delegation to vote as a single bloc. According to City & State, Brooklyn has the largest delegation but has not been as influential as Queens or the Bronx in recent speaker races. Bichotte Hermelyn hopes a united front will prevent Brooklyn from getting "the short end of the stick."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants. The move would expand federal detention capacity as the government seeks to escalate immigration roundups in New York City. Separately, in New York, the federal use of county jails for immigrant detention has surged this year under President Trump's deportation agenda.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A judge has ordered New York City to temporarily halt any new agreement over the use of Citi Field's parking lot with Mets owner Steve Cohen. The order could potentially derail Cohen's bid to build a casino in the area. In other local news, Brooklyn Hospital Center is warning it could be forced to shut down by the end of the year if it does not receive state assistance. And conservationists are again pressing Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign a ban on harvesting horseshoe crabs in state waters, a measure she vetoed last year.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The Bulwark, the Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other global assistance programs has had devastating consequences. In an interview, Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and former USAID official, stated that the halt of foreign aid has led to an estimated 600,000 deaths so far, 400,000 of them children, from lack of access to HIV medication, food aid, and other essential services. A new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," produced by Gawande and The New Yorker, highlights the human toll, focusing on a Sudanese refugee in Kenya whose daughter is suffering from severe malnutrition due to cuts in food rations previously supported by the U.S.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump told reporters he has "sort of" decided on how to proceed regarding Venezuela but did not offer details. The comments followed days of high-level meetings where top administration officials discussed possible military operations in the country. A classified DOJ brief reportedly justifies potential action by describing fentanyl as a chemical weapons threat and alleging that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro leads a drug cartel.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the Middle East, a fragile ceasefire in Gaza is holding, though many remain displaced without running water or electricity. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is planning a meeting with a chief Hamas negotiator as the administration continues to monitor the peace transition. Elsewhere, the Trump administration is pursuing an expansion of the U.S. government's list of foreign terrorist organizations to include left-wing groups in Europe and Latin American drug-trafficking organizations, a move experts describe as highly unusual.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Patients are increasingly turning to A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, according to The New York Times. A survey found about one in six adults use chatbots for medical information, citing long wait times, inattentive doctors, and high costs in the traditional healthcare system as primary motivators. Users reported that chatbots offer a kinder, more empathetic experience and make them feel their concerns are being heard. While doctors acknowledge flaws in the medical system, they express worry over patients relying on bots that can provide incomplete or fabricated answers for high-stakes health decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The cable news channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW this morning. The change, part of a reported $20 million effort, follows the network's spin-out from NBC Universal. In an interview with POLITICO, hosts noted the challenge of operating in a splintered media ecosystem but emphasized their ability to make news and reach viewers across platforms like YouTube.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In entertainment, director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" is now available on Netflix. The Atlantic describes the film as a "handsome, burnished production" with deep compassion, though questions if it feels "inert." A new book by journalist Olivia Nuzzi details her career-altering relationship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., exploring how the infatuation consumed her.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In San Francisco, driverless taxis are facing new scrutiny after one of the vehicles killed a beloved cat. And in a scientific breakthrough, researchers have successfully sequenced RNA from the remains of a 39,000-year-old mammoth, by far the oldest on record. The study, detailed in 404 Media, also revealed that the famous mammoth mummy, known as Yuka, was male, not female as previously believed.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times's Michelle Cottle argues that Democrats need a "wartime consigliere" and that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries is not one, describing him as too "benign" to be a compelling opposition figure in the Trump era. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Jean Twenge writes that to improve test scores and student well-being, schools should ban not just smartphones but also laptops and tablets. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/schools-ban-laptops-tablets.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/schools-ban-laptops-tablets.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch featured a debate on the Senate filibuster. John McCormack argues that we will miss the filibuster when it's gone, as it serves as a crucial check on partisanship and executive overreach. In a counterpoint, Andrew Egger contends that the filibuster should be eliminated because it no longer encourages compromise and only weakens an already impotent Congress. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/">https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Washington Post, John Bolton outlines what he believes is the "right way to overthrow Maduro" in Venezuela. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/14/john-bolton-venezuela-maduro-overthrow-strategy/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/14/john-bolton-venezuela-maduro-overthrow-strategy/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn interviews surgeon and former USAID official Atul Gawande about what may be the "cruelest, most senseless thing Trump has done": dismantling U.S. foreign aid. Gawande details the catastrophic human toll of the policy, including hundreds of thousands of deaths among the world's most vulnerable. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times's Jamelle Bouie observes that Vice President JD Vance is remaining quiet amid the internal conservative conflict over Tucker Carlson's friendly interview with neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes, suggesting Vance is "groyper adjacent" and fears the political consequences of a disavowal. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html</a></p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally cut federal funding to the University of California system over the administration's claims of antisemitism and discrimination. In New York, the SUNY Board of Trustees took the unusual step of formally voting down the nomination of Maria Conzatti to become president of Nassau Community College, escalating a years-long leadership dispute at the school.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.S. penny was officially eliminated this week by the Trump administration after 232 years in circulation. A study published in the journal *Radiology* used fMRI scans to observe the brains of football fans during games, finding that while scoring against rivals activated the brain's reward system, conceding goals to rivals triggered networks associated with mentalization and inhibited cognitive control, suggesting impaired emotional regulation in highly engaged fans. Finally, stargazers can look forward to the Leonids meteor shower, which is expected to reach its peak tonight.</p>
