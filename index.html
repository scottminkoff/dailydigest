<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed he has been served with grand jury subpoenas by the Justice Department, which is investigating whether he lied to Congress regarding the cost and scale of renovations at the Fed’s headquarters. Powell characterized the criminal inquiry as a "pretext" for political intimidation, arguing the administration is actually retaliating against the central bank for refusing to cut interest rates according to President Trump’s preferences. The escalation has rattled Washington, with GOP Senator Thom Tillis pledging to block future Fed nominees until the standoff is resolved.

The fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis has triggered a nationwide backlash, prompting the Trump administration to deploy hundreds of additional federal agents to the city to protect immigration enforcement operations. While the White House maintains the agent acted in self-defense against an act of "domestic terrorism," local officials and Democratic Senators have accused the administration of a cover-up and are moving to restrict congressional oversight visits to detention facilities. Protests have erupted in major cities including New York and Boston, intensifying the conflict between local Democratic leaders and federal authorities.

The event highlights Musk's rehabilitation within the president's orbit following a previous falling out, evidenced by his recent inclusion in high-level diplomatic dinners and policy discussions. President Trump has also indicated he may call upon Musk to deploy Starlink internet services to aid anti-regime protesters in Iran.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
New York Democrats, including Governor Kathy Hochul, are aggressively countering federal immigration enforcement tactics following the shooting of Renee Good, with proposals to allow civil lawsuits against federal agents who violate constitutional rights. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is pushing for "New York For All" legislation that would block local law enforcement from coordinating with ICE, while other lawmakers seek to require agents to show their faces during operations. The rhetoric marks a sharp pivot from previous caution, as even moderate Democrats argue that "masked, armed men" on state streets are eroding public trust.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani plans to attend Governor Hochul's State of the State address in Albany, signaling a potential thaw in relations after missing legislative sessions last year. Mamdani has publicly praised Hochul’s plan for universal childcare, a key area of alignment as he settles into office and prepares to move into Gracie Mansion. The mayor is also advancing his own agenda, recently announcing a plan to expand bus lanes on Madison Avenue, reversing a delay from the previous administration.

A coalition of over 70 elected officials from New York City and the state legislature is urging the Public Service Commission to reject Con Edison’s proposed electric and gas rate hikes. The officials argue that the three-year proposal would exacerbate the affordability crisis and push more residents into utility debt. This pushback comes as Representative Pat Ryan released survey results showing nearly 100% of respondents in his district are already struggling with rising grocery and living costs.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Iran’s parliament speaker has warned that any U.S. military attack on Iranian soil would result in retaliatory strikes against Israel and American bases in the region. This threat comes as Israeli officials report being on high alert regarding potential U.S. intervention in Iran, with Prime Minister Netanyahu discussing the volatile situation directly with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Netanyahu condemned the Iranian regime's crackdown on protesters while confirming close monitoring of the unfolding events.

Israel Police have detained and interrogated Tzachi Braverman, Prime Minister Netanyahu's former chief of staff, in connection with the "BibiLeaks" affair. The investigation centers on the alleged leak of classified IDF documents to foreign media in 2024, which was reportedly intended to influence public opinion against ceasefire protests. Police searched Braverman's home and seized his phone as part of the inquiry.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani faced scrutiny for his delayed response to a pro-Hamas chant at a protest in a Jewish neighborhood in Queens. While he eventually condemned the language as having "no place in our city," the delay, coupled with his past calls to defund the police, has tested his tenuous relationship with Jewish constituents. Mamdani has since defended undoing executive orders regarding the definition of antisemitism defined by his predecessor.

The United States is weighing military strikes against Iran in response to the regime's violent crackdown on protesters, with President Trump receiving hourly briefings on potential targets. Iranian leaders have reportedly reached out to negotiate a potential nuclear deal to stave off attacks, though the U.S. remains skeptical and prepared to act. Human rights groups estimate over 500 people have died and nearly 11,000 have been arrested during the recent unrest in Iran.

The Trump administration is accelerating efforts to lift sanctions on Venezuela to facilitate U.S. investment in the country's oil sector, framing the resources as a means to cover intervention costs. President Trump issued an executive order blocking creditors from seizing Venezuelan funds to ensure they are used for economic stabilization, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent plans meetings with the IMF and World Bank. Despite these moves, major U.S. oil companies like ExxonMobil remain hesitant, viewing the country as currently "uninvestable."

The U.S. military launched large-scale airstrikes across Syria, targeting Islamic State infrastructure and militants in response to an attack last month that killed American service members. The operation, termed "Hawkeye Strike," involved fighter jets and drones dropping over 90 bombs on at least 35 targets associated with the terror group. This marks the second major aerial attack in the campaign to degrade ISIS capabilities in the region.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Mississippi has emerged as an unexpected leader in education reform, ranking in the top 10 for fourth-grade reading after being ranked 49th just over a decade ago. The state's "miracle" is attributed to a combination of embracing the "science of reading" (phonics), holding schools accountable for test scores, and deploying literacy coaches to support teachers in struggling schools. This success story challenges the notion that low education spending and high poverty inevitably lead to poor academic outcomes.

New data reveals that 335,000 federal workers left government service last year, the largest exodus since the 1990s. While only 11,000 departures were direct layoffs from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the agency's buyout programs contributed significantly to the 154,000 resignations. The workforce reductions have hit the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Treasury Department the hardest.

The U.S. economy added 50,000 nonfarm jobs in December, falling short of the expected 73,000 and marking a 12% decrease from the previous month. Unemployment dipped slightly to 4.4% due to a shrinking labor force, while the median duration of unemployment rose to a four-year high of 11.4 weeks. Growth was concentrated in healthcare and hospitality, while retail, construction, and manufacturing sectors shed jobs.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Jerusalem Demsas argues that independent agencies like the Federal Reserve are essential for preventing short-term political whims from destabilizing the economy, even if they occasionally spark populist backlash. She contends that while technocracy can feel anti-democratic, insulating complex policy decisions from voters prevents disastrous outcomes like runaway inflation. Demsas warns that eroding this independence, as President Trump appears to be doing with his attacks on Jerome Powell, risks long-term economic health for short-term political gain.

Matthew Yglesias critiques the Trump administration's approach to Venezuela, comparing it to 19th-century imperialist arguments that wealth comes from extraction rather than positive-sum growth. He argues that seizing Venezuela's oil infrastructure is unlikely to generate the prosperity Trump promises, much like historical colonial ventures often failed to enrich the colonizer. Yglesias suggests that modern economic strength comes from trade and innovation, not the coercive seizure of natural resources.
