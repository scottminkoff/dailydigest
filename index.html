    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A major intra-party conflict is consuming Republicans as former President Donald Trump has publicly broken with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The dispute centers on Greene's persistent calls for the full release of the Justice Department's files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump escalated the feud on Truth Social, calling Greene a "ranting lunatic" and a "RINO," and signaling support for a primary challenge against her. In an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Greene said Trump's comments, particularly calling her a "traitor," were "hurtful" and could endanger her life. She maintained her support for his agenda but said she is committed to moving away from "toxic politics."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on legislation from Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna (D-CA) that would compel the release of the Epstein files. Massie said he hopes for a "veto-proof majority." Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking on "Fox News Sunday," dismissed the idea that Trump is concerned about the files. Meanwhile, after Trump demanded an investigation into Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, Attorney General Pam Bondi named Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to lead a new probe. According to The New York Times, this places Clayton, who had previously avoided Trump's most charged cases, at the center of a politically explosive issue.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, the Department of Transportation announced it is easing flight cuts at 40 major airports due to improved air traffic controller staffing. Funding for the SNAP program has also resumed, though Republican cuts are expected to force millions off food stamps in the coming months. A CBS poll found that Americans believe Republicans won the shutdown standoff by a 55 to 6 percent margin. In Congress, some moderate House Republicans are now pushing for a deal to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent premium hikes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times investigation found that the Trump administration has transformed the Department of Homeland Security into a "Department of Deportation." The report states that thousands of federal agents have been diverted from combating child exploitation, sex trafficking, and terrorism financing to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants. This crackdown has now begun in Charlotte, N.C., with masked Border Patrol agents making numerous arrests. The next target for the operation is reportedly New Orleans. Concurrently, The Dispatch reports that DHS is using nativist messaging in a large-scale recruitment effort to preserve a specific view of American culture.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The turmoil on the right extends to the Heritage Foundation, where President Kevin Roberts defended Tucker Carlson's recent friendly interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. The incident sparked outrage among some Heritage staffers and highlighted a broader identity crisis within conservative institutions. Vice President JD Vance has remained quiet on the controversy, which Nick Fuentes has interpreted as a victory for his far-right "groyper" movement.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, Trump has pardoned two more individuals for crimes related to the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Disclosures also show Trump has purchased at least $82 million in bonds since late August. Separately, newly released documents revealed that former Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler's surprise departure in August coincided with an ethics investigation into her trading of individual stocks, which is against Fed rules.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The race for New York City Council speaker is intensifying, with the 17-member Brooklyn delegation attempting to unify as a powerful voting bloc. According to City & State, Brooklyn Democratic Party Leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is working to unite progressive and moderate members to avoid being marginalized as in past elections. Council Members Julie Menin and Crystal Hudson are viewed as front-runners, with Amanda Farías seen as a potential compromise candidate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly exploring the use of a U.S. Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants as it seeks to escalate immigration enforcement in the city. This comes as the federal government's use of county jails in New York for ICE detentions has surged this year under the president's deportation agenda. Data on immigration arrests and court hearings has not been updated since the government shutdown began.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Queens, a judge has ordered a temporary halt to any new agreement over the use of the Citi Field parking lot. The ruling could jeopardize Mets owner Steve Cohen's bid to build a casino on the site.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Brooklyn Hospital Center administrators are warning that the facility may be forced to shut down by the end of the year if it does not receive financial assistance from Gov. Kathy Hochul's administration. In Albany, SUNY trustees took the rare step of formally rejecting the nomination of Maria Conzatti to lead Nassau Community College, escalating a years-long leadership dispute.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly considering military options in Venezuela. President Trump told reporters he has "sort of" decided on a course of action following days of high-level meetings. According to The Wall Street Journal, a classified DOJ brief justifies potential military action by describing fentanyl as a chemical weapons threat posed by Venezuelan drug cartels.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In an interview with The Bulwark, writer and surgeon Dr. Atul Gawande discussed the devastating human toll of the Trump administration's decision to halt foreign aid and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Gawande, who helped produce a new documentary on the subject titled "Rovina's Choice," said the cuts have already led to an estimated 600,000 deaths, including 400,000 children, primarily from disease and malnutrition. He called the move an "assault on the idea of cooperation to solve big problems."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Ukraine, Russia launched a major drone and missile attack on Kyiv, killing at least six people. The strikes targeted the country's power grid as winter approaches. Elsewhere, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is planning to meet with a senior Hamas negotiator as the administration monitors the fragile ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump Organization is in talks for a potential Trump-branded property deal with a large Saudi government-owned real estate development. The news comes as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is scheduled to visit Washington next week.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The cable news channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW on Saturday morning. The change, part of a reported $20 million effort, comes as the channel's parent company, Versant, spins out from NBC Universal. In an interview with POLITICO, hosts said the mission remains the same despite the new name and graphics, and that they aim to be nimble in a splintering media ecosystem where podcasts and YouTube are major competitors.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A growing number of patients are turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, according to a report in The New York Times. A survey found that one in six adults consults bots for medical information. Users told The Times they find the AI to be more attentive and accessible than the traditional health care system, often praising its empathetic "bedside manner." However, doctors expressed concern about the technology's potential for giving incomplete or fabricated answers to high-stakes health questions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The BBC is facing a crisis after editing a speech by President Trump, for which it later apologized. Trump has since threatened to sue the broadcaster for as much as $5 billion. In San Francisco, the expansion of driverless taxis hit a snag after one of the vehicles killed a beloved local cat, sparking controversy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In her new book, journalist Olivia Nuzzi writes about the professional fallout from her digital affair with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And in film, director Guillermo del Toro's adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" is now available on Netflix.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Michelle Cottle argues that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries' fatal flaw is that he is "too smooth, too reasonable, too benign to cut a compelling opposition figure in the Trump era." <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Washington Post editorial board writes that killing the U.S. penny was the right move, but the Trump administration erred by not working with Congress on legislation for a smoother, less inflationary exit. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/14/end-of-penny-right-call-bad-process/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/14/end-of-penny-right-call-bad-process/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jamelle Bouie, writing in his New York Times newsletter, observes that Vice President JD Vance is "functionally 'groyper adjacent'" and that his silence on Tucker Carlson's interview with neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes is a victory for the far-right movement. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn interviews Dr. Atul Gawande, who describes the Trump administration's dismantling of foreign aid as possibly "the cruelest, most senseless thing" it has done, detailing the catastrophic loss of life from disease and starvation as a result. <a href="https://thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">https://thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonah Goldberg, in The Dispatch's G-File, argues that various factions on the right, including postliberals and nationalists, share "intellectual and political DNA" with Nick Fuentes and have contributed to his rise, even if they now disavow him. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Washington Post, John Bolton outlines what he considers "the right way to overthrow Maduro" in Venezuela. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/11/john-bolton-this-is-right-way-overthrow-maduro/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/11/john-bolton-this-is-right-way-overthrow-maduro/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in POLITICO Magazine, David Litt suggests that a recent comedian's performance showed Democrats how to solve their messaging problems. <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2025/11/11/pete-davidson-snl-democrats-messaging-231367">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2025/11/11/pete-davidson-snl-democrats-messaging-231367</a></p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees took the unusual step of formally voting down the nomination of Maria Conzatti to become the president of Nassau Community College. The move escalates a leadership battle that has lasted more than three years.

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Scientists have achieved a significant genetic breakthrough by sequencing RNA from a 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth mummy named Yuka. As reported by 404 Media, this marks by far the oldest RNA ever sequenced, pushing the timeline back by 25,000 years. The research also revealed a surprise: genetic analysis of Yuka's Y chromosome indicates the mammoth was male, correcting the long-held belief that it was female.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">After 232 years, the American penny was officially discontinued this week by the U.S. Mint. Also, the Leonids meteor shower is expected to reach its peak tonight, with favorable viewing conditions due to a mostly dark moon.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In ecological news, a new study highlights the vital role of beavers as "ecosystem engineers." Researchers found that their dams create biodiverse havens and fire-resistant habitats that are resilient to the impacts of climate change.</p>
