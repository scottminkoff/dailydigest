    <div class="content"><h4>November 18, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">After months of opposition, President Trump abruptly reversed his stance and endorsed a House vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The move came Sunday night, just before a scheduled Tuesday vote on a bipartisan measure, led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, that was expected to pass with significant Republican support despite White House pressure. Trump stated on Truth Social that Republicans "have nothing to hide," and a White House official told Politico they expect the bill will pass both chambers and be signed into law. However, Trump also instructed the Justice Department to investigate Democrats' ties to Epstein, a move some legal experts suggest could provide the DOJ with a pretext to withhold some documents from public release, citing an ongoing inquiry. A recent Morning Consult poll indicates that 60 percent of Americans believe Trump was aware of Epstein's criminal activities.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Justice Department's case against former FBI Director James Comey may be in jeopardy. A federal magistrate judge issued a blistering assessment of the prosecution, citing a "disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps" and potential misconduct by the Trump-appointed prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan. The judge wrote that irregularities in the grand jury proceedings "may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr. Comey" and ordered prosecutors to turn over complete grand jury records to the defense team, suggesting a dismissal of the case is possible.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has proposed stripping federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, a move that could affect drinking water for millions of Americans. The proposal, which would roll back the scope of the 1972 Clean Water Act, is seen as a victory for real estate developers, farmers, and petrochemical manufacturers. Environmental groups have responded with outrage, noting the proposal could impact up to 55 million acres of wetlands. This follows other administration decisions to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, David Richardson has resigned as the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after just six months in the role. The Federal Reserve plans to loosen its regulations for banks, sparking concern among some experts about the risk of another financial crisis. A Tennessee judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard in Memphis, siding with lawmakers who argued the governor overstepped his authority. Meanwhile, U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a major immigration sweep in Charlotte, North Carolina, arresting more than 130 people over the weekend.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new Siena College poll shows Governor Kathy Hochul holding a 20-point lead over her announced Republican challenger, Rep. Elise Stefanik, 52% to 32%. The poll also found Hochul with a commanding lead over Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in a hypothetical Democratic primary. However, the governor's favorability rating is underwater, with 45% of voters viewing her unfavorably compared to 43% favorably. In the same poll, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s popularity has hit an all-time low, with a 55% unfavorable rating.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani prepares to take office, he faces several early challenges, including navigating relationships with political allies and a hostile federal government. Mamdani will require a top-level security clearance, and it remains unclear if the Trump administration will grant it. He is also reportedly at odds with Comptroller Brad Lander and the NYC-DSA over a potential primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman. Meanwhile, NYC-DSA has endorsed Council Member Alexa Avilés for that seat. In a sign of pragmatism, Mamdani has expressed confidence in his plan to retain Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor Eric Adams has embarked on a multi-day trip to Israel, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Following his visit, Adams will travel to Uzbekistan for five days. His administration faces new scrutiny after court papers alleged that top officials worked to undermine sexual harassment and retaliation claims made against mayoral adviser Timothy Pearson. Adams's November budget modification increased city spending to $118 billion, leaving a projected $4.7 billion deficit for the incoming Mamdani administration.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Hochul has indicated that fiscal uncertainty in Washington will influence whether she supports tax hikes in the next state budget, though she remains opposed to increasing personal income tax. She is also urging the Trump administration to release $400 million in federal heating assistance funds for New Yorkers. Separately, the state has agreed to delay the implementation of its all-electric buildings law as a court case proceeds.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other political developments, NYC Council Member Chi Ossé has opened a fundraising account to launch a primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a move that progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mayor-elect Mamdani have indicated they do not support. Assemblymember Stacey Pheffer Amato, a Queens Democrat, announced she will not seek reelection in 2026. And in an unusual move, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indefinitely canceled naturalization ceremonies in at least seven upstate New York counties, leaving hundreds of aspiring citizens in limbo.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United Nations Security Council voted to adopt a U.S.-proposed peace plan for Gaza, marking a significant diplomatic breakthrough for the Trump administration. The plan, which calls for the creation of a multinational stabilization force, the resumption of aid, and the establishment of a transitional technocratic government, gained the backing of multiple Arab and Muslim nations. Russia and China abstained from the vote. The resolution gives President Trump's 20-point plan the weight of international law, though many steps remain for implementation. Despite the plan's passage, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his government's opposition to an independent Palestinian state.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a related development, Germany announced it would resume arms exports to Israel that it had paused in August, citing the "stabilized" ceasefire with Hamas. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu condemned the recent increase in settler violence in the West Bank, where extremists attacked a Palestinian village and burned cars and homes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to visit the White House today for a two-day visit, his first to the U.S. since the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. President Trump announced he will approve the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, and a U.S.-Saudi security agreement is expected to be signed. According to Axios, the Israeli government is not opposed to the F-35 sale, provided Saudi Arabia also agrees to normalize relations with Israel.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Political turmoil is escalating in the United Kingdom, where both Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party and the opposition Conservative Party are languishing with approval ratings below 20%. According to The Dispatch, this widespread disillusionment, fueled by economic stagnation and anger over immigration, is fracturing the country's traditional two-party system. Nigel Farage's right-populist Reform Party is now polling at 29% and threatening to supplant the Conservatives as the main party of the right. The far-left Green Party and the center-left Liberal Democrats are also gaining significant support.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Eastern Europe, Poland's Prime Minister stated that a recent railway line explosion was an "unprecedented act of sabotage," likely carried out on the orders of "foreign services." The damaged line is used to transport supplies to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a letter of intent in Paris to purchase up to 100 Rafale fighter jets from France. Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine, launching a drone assault on Dnipro and firing missiles into the Kharkiv region, killing at least nine people.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has stated he would not rule out deploying U.S. troops in Venezuela as he builds up a military presence in the Caribbean. He also indicated he is open to speaking with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. In South America, Chile's presidential election is headed to a runoff between Communist Party member Jeannette Jara and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Elsewhere, the European Union is reportedly scaling back its landmark data privacy law, G.D.P.R., signaling a shift toward a more U.S.-style approach to regulating Big Tech. In Bangladesh, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last year, was sentenced to death in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity for ordering the use of lethal force against protestors in 2024.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a challenge to NASA's delayed Artemis program, China plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and has already conducted successful unmanned missions to the moon's far side. The 21st-century space race is focused on the lunar south pole, where permanently shadowed craters may hold frozen water that could be converted into rocket fuel, oxygen, and drinking water for a future human presence.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The email application Spark has introduced a new personal AI Assistant designed to search, summarize, and draft emails, as well as organize a user's inbox and calendar. The feature integrates with a user's accounts, calendar, and meeting notes across desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new research project is using featherweight, solar-powered radio tags to track the migration of monarch butterflies. The technology, which provides unprecedented insight into insect journeys, allows the public to follow individual butterflies through a free app. The New York Times followed six of them on their journey to winter colonies in Mexico.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In entertainment, the documentary film genre is facing a crisis of trust, according to The New York Times. Critics cite a combination of technological advances in AI and a trend of "authorized documentaries," where subjects retain editorial control, as undermining the relationship between filmmakers and viewers. In other news, Dolly Parton, Debbie Allen, and Tom Cruise were awarded honorary Oscars at the Governors Awards.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system over alleged civil rights violations related to antisemitism. The judge ruled the administration cannot use "coercive" threats to withhold millions of dollars in federal research grants from the university.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data reveals that the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges began before the Trump administration, with a 7 percent drop last fall precipitated by waning interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures suggest the trend will worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">At Harvard University, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said he was "deeply ashamed" of his ties to Jeffrey Epstein and will step back from some public commitments, but he plans to continue teaching at the university.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Duke University's women's leadership program will now be open to men. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the change is one of many actions on college campuses to alter or eliminate programs amid pressure to end identity-conscious recruitment and retention efforts.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Boiling Frogs, Nick Catoggio argues that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's rebellion against President Trump over the Epstein files is a significant threat to his authority. He writes that her successful defiance stands for the proposition that MAGA populism has ideological content beyond the president's whims, representing the first successful challenge to Trump's supremacy as the arbiter of his movement's orthodoxy. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/marjorie-taylor-greene-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/marjorie-taylor-greene-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias contends that the Democratic senators who pushed to end the government shutdown were not "moderates," but rather progressives prioritizing immediate policy outcomes—like protecting federal workers and SNAP recipients—over a political hardball strategy that could have inflicted more damage on President Trump. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation</a></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for Jewish Currents, Gabi Kirk analyzes a new "antisemitism prevention" law in California, arguing that it is part of a long-running campaign against ethnic studies curricula and, ironically, makes it more difficult to engage with the shifting conditions of Jewish identity. <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss">https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss</a></p>
