    <div class="content"><h4>November 19, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House and Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill to compel the Justice Department to release all files related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The House vote was 427-1, and the Senate approved it by unanimous consent. President Trump, who had previously lobbied against the bill and attacked its supporters, reversed his position and is now expected to sign it into law. In a separate incident, President Trump told Bloomberg reporter Catherine Lucey, "Quiet, piggy," when she pressed him with questions about the files. In other legal news concerning the former financier, The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that Epstein's emails reveal deep ties with prominent researchers, who are shown asking him for funding and advice on handling sexual-misconduct allegations. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said he was "deeply ashamed" of his ties to Epstein and would step back from some public commitments.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House, signing an agreement to sell F-35 fighter jets to the kingdom and a declaration on civil nuclear energy cooperation. When asked about a U.S. intelligence report that concluded the prince ordered the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump defended his guest, stating, "You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that," and adding that "a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman." The state dinner was attended by tech executives including Tim Cook and Elon Musk, as well as finance and sports figures.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The White House is on the brink of unveiling a secret 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, which was reportedly drafted in direct consultation with Russia but without input from Ukraine or European allies. Separately, Russian forces launched a missile and drone attack on Western Ukraine, killing at least 16 people in the city of Ternopil.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In domestic policy, the Trump administration announced plans to dismantle the Department of Education, outsourcing six of its offices, including grant-making programs for college access, to other agencies like the Department of Labor. The administration also proposed stripping federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams by scaling back the Clean Water Act, a move that would make it easier for industries to pollute.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new poll from The New York Times and KFF found that while about half of immigrants feel less safe since President Trump took office, 70% would still choose to migrate to the U.S., and 80% feel they are on the path to achieving the American dream. However, fear of deportation has led many to avoid daily activities.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, a federal judge indicated that the malicious prosecution case against former FBI Director James Comey might be dismissed due to a "disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps" by the Trump-appointed prosecutor. A federal court blocked Texas's new Republican-friendly congressional map, calling it a likely illegal racial gerrymander. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case, *Watson v. RNC*, challenging state laws that allow mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive shortly after. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission over its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new Siena College poll shows Governor Kathy Hochul with a 20-point lead over Republican challenger Rep. Elise Stefanik, 52% to 32%. The poll also highlighted a key difference between potential GOP rivals, noting that Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman is pro-choice, while Stefanik is pro-life with exceptions. In a hypothetical Democratic primary, Hochul leads Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado 56% to 16%. The poll also found that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's popularity in the state has hit an all-time low.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In New York City, Council Member Chi Ossé has launched a primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. However, prominent progressives, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, have indicated they do not support the bid. The race to succeed retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler is also growing, with March for Our Lives co-founder Cameron Kasky and LGBTQ+ activist Mathew Shurka entering the Democratic primary.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As his term ends, Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-country, taxpayer-funded trip that includes Israel and Uzbekistan, during which he has admitted to looking for his next job. Before leaving, Adams increased the city budget, leaving his successor, Mamdani, with a projected $4.7 billion deficit. In response to Mamdani's election, President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has vowed to "flood the zone" with increased ICE enforcement in the city.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In state news, New York plans to close a North Country prison due to staffing shortages, the 13th such closure in a decade. A judge dismissed a Department of Justice challenge to a state law that bans immigration agents from making arrests in courthouses. In Buffalo, Mayor-elect Sean Ryan warned that the city is in "dire financial straits" and will need a state bailout to close a budget gap that could reach $50 million. In a positive development for the state's higher education system, SUNY announced its enrollment has increased for the third consecutive year.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.N. Security Council adopted a U.S.-proposed peace plan for Gaza, with Russia and China abstaining. The 20-point plan, which now has the weight of international law, calls for the creation of a multinational stabilization force, the resumption of aid, and the establishment of a transitional technocratic government. The deal was backed by several Arab and Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the West Bank, one man was killed and three others were injured in a terrorist attack at the Gush Etzion Junction, where two Palestinians drove their car into a crowd before stabbing people. Israeli security forces shot and killed both attackers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned a recent increase in settler violence in the West Bank.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israel Defense Forces conducted an airstrike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, which it claimed was targeting a Hamas "military compound." Lebanese authorities reported 13 people were killed. Hamas denied having military installations in the camp. Separately, an Israeli human rights group released a report alleging that 94 Palestinian prisoners have been killed while in Israeli custody over the past two years.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said an explosion on a railway line used to carry supplies to Ukraine was an "unprecedented act of sabotage," suggesting it was likely ordered by "foreign services." Tusk did not name Russia, but the Kremlin denied involvement, calling the accusation "Russophobia."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new investigative report from The New York Times and The Examination reveals a severe public health crisis in Ogijo, Nigeria, where residents suffer from lead poisoning due to factories recycling old car batteries. The lead dust contaminates homes and public spaces, causing irreversible brain damage, particularly in children. The recycled lead is often used in new products, including batteries for American cars.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Elsewhere, the first doses of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly HIV prevention injection, were delivered to Eswatini and Zambia. Belgian police arrested eight people in connection with a plot to assassinate the Brussels chief prosecutor. In Bangladesh, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity for ordering the use of lethal force against student protesters in 2024.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As part of its plan to dismantle the Department of Education, the Trump administration is outsourcing grant-making programs that support college access and student success to the Department of Labor. In related news, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education, researchers at universities that struck deals with the administration to save research funding have expressed mixed feelings about the arrangements.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An investigation by The Chronicle into Jeffrey Epstein’s emails revealed his deep ties to prominent academic researchers, who sought funding from the disgraced financier and asked for his advice on handling their own sexual-misconduct allegations.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Investigators found that the six construction workers who died in the Baltimore bridge collapse last year might have survived had police alerted them about the incoming ship. The crash was determined to have been caused by a small, misplaced sticker on a wire.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Toyota announced it will invest $912 million in American plants across five Southern states to increase the production of hybrid vehicles.

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias argues that a true political focus on "affordability" requires making difficult choices that may alienate parts of a party's coalition. He points to President Trump's reversal on some tariffs as a pragmatic move Democrats struggle with, citing examples like New York's costly two-person subway crew mandate and renewable energy standards that raise electricity prices. He contends that to genuinely address the cost of living, politicians must confront these tradeoffs rather than just adopting the language of affordability. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices">https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch's Nick Catoggio criticizes House Democratic leadership for opposing a resolution to rebuke Rep. Chuy García. García timed his retirement to ensure his chief of staff would be the only Democrat on the primary ballot to succeed him. Catoggio argues that by choosing "unity" over sanctioning corrupt machine politics, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a "Trumpy" turn that undermines the party's claims to be a force for good government. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/garcia-gluesenkamp-perez-democrats-jeffries-election-illinois/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/garcia-gluesenkamp-perez-democrats-jeffries-election-illinois/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in The New York Times, Ross Douthat analyzes the rise of "post-liberalism" on the right, defining it as a response to the perceived crisis of the current liberal order. He argues that post-liberal thinkers are better at describing the sources of the crisis—such as technological disruption and secularization—than they are at prescribing viable solutions. Douthat concludes that both liberals and post-liberals are currently locked in a "cycle of mutual failure," unable to master events, and that a new synthesis of ideas will be necessary to navigate the current era. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/what-is-post-liberalism-anyway.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/what-is-post-liberalism-anyway.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan V. Last writes that the flurry of Republican proposals to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies are variations on the old, failed idea of "consumer-driven health care." He asserts that decades of evidence show that people do not "shop" for medical care and that shifting more costs to individuals causes them to forgo necessary treatment, ultimately leading to worse health outcomes and higher costs. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gary Rosenblatt, in his newsletter, points to an internal conflict at The New York Times over a report on Hamas's sexual violence as an example of "activist journalism." He cites a study and commentators like Matti Friedman and Bret Stephens, who argue that a new generation of progressive journalists prioritizes pushing a political viewpoint over objective reporting, particularly on Israel. <a href="https://garyrosenblatt.substack.com/p/how-israel-lost-the-media-war-part">https://garyrosenblatt.substack.com/p/how-israel-lost-the-media-war-part</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Editors, Robert L. Friedman critiques a recent webinar from a Palestine-focused program at Harvard's School of Public Health. He argues the event was a one-sided political exercise that repeatedly labeled Israel's actions as "genocide" while ignoring the context of the October 7th attacks and Hamas's role in the conflict, subverting the school's public health mission for political activism. <a href="https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization">https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">David A. Graham of The Atlantic argues that President Trump's reversal on releasing the Epstein files demonstrates he is a terrible political ally. After demanding House Republicans oppose the release, Trump abandoned them when their resistance failed, leaving them politically exposed while attempting to save himself. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/11/trumps-epstein-files-punt/684999/">https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/11/trumps-epstein-files-punt/684999/</a></p>
