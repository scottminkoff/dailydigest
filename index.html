President Trump posted and subsequently deleted a video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, following swift backlash from Republican allies including Senator Tim Scott and Rep. Mike Lawler. The incident marks a rare moment where GOP officials publicly criticized the president on moral grounds, with the White House initially dismissing the criticism as "fake outrage" before removing the post and blaming a staffer. Analysts suggest this pushback may be driven by electoral self-interest as the President's popularity faces headwinds from economic dissatisfaction.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that the administration can indefinitely detain certain non-citizens without bond, adopting an interpretation of immigration law rejected by most other courts. This decision creates a split with other jurisdictions and is fueling an ICE push to transfer detainees to Texas to utilize the favorable legal precedent. Legal experts note that unless a habeas petition is filed before a person is physically transferred to the Fifth Circuit, they may remain locked in detention without a chance for bond.

President Trump has officially launched "TrumpRx," an online platform assisting customers in purchasing certain medications directly from manufacturers. While the administration claims drugs will be available at the "lowest price anywhere," critics note that many listed medications are already covered by insurance, making the actual consumer savings unclear. The platform currently lists 43 medications following negotiations with at least 16 drugmakers.

ICE is considering purchasing large warehouses in 20 locations to serve as migrant detention centers, potentially holding up to 8,000 people at some sites. This expansion coincides with the Department of Justice detaining a Minnesota activist for social media posts encouraging violence against federal agents, whom he labeled "gestapo." Additionally, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking ICE from detaining suspected undocumented immigrants in Oregon without a warrant.

A new Marquette Law School survey indicates that 63% of Americans believe the Supreme Court should limit the president's authority to impose tariffs. Public approval of the Court has dropped to 44%, with more than half of respondents feeling the justices are going out of their way to avoid ruling against Trump. The poll highlights growing public skepticism regarding the Court's handling of executive power disputes.

Construction on the massive Hudson River rail tunnel project has been suspended after the Trump administration froze funding, reportedly making its release contingent on renaming Penn Station and Dulles Airport after the president. While Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer rebuffed the renaming demand, a federal judge has ordered the administration to unlock the funding as litigation proceeds. The funding freeze threatens the timeline of the largest transportation infrastructure project in the nation.

New York Democrats have officially designated Governor Kathy Hochul, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, and Attorney General Letitia James as their nominees for reelection at the state party convention. Despite a brief, chaotic rescission of support from the Brooklyn Democratic Party earlier in the week, Hochul secured over 85% of the delegate vote. Hochul accepted the nomination with a call to defend democratic pillars against attacks from the current presidency.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has issued an executive order directing city agencies to audit their policies regarding cooperation with federal immigration agents.

Robert Kraft’s $15 million Super Bowl ad campaign against antisemitism is drawing criticism for promoting a narrative of Jewish victimhood. Critics argue the ad features a "quivering Jew" archetype waiting for a righteous gentile savior, rather than encouraging Jewish pride and self-defense.

Jack Goldsmith argues that the federal judiciary has effectively "stood up" to the Trump administration, citing numerous court losses for the administration in immigration and personnel cases. While acknowledging some chaos in lower courts, Goldsmith contends the system as a whole is functioning as a check on executive overreach. He notes the Supreme Court's "invisible influence" in deterring the Solicitor General from seeking interim relief in weak cases.

Nick Catoggio analyzes the Republican pushback against Trump's racist post, suggesting it is driven by self-interest as the President's popularity wanes due to economic dissatisfaction. He argues that voters may no longer be willing to accept the "devil's bargain" of tolerating moral depravity for economic gain if the economy isn't delivering. The piece questions whether this moral outrage is genuine or merely opportunistic political distancing.
