    <h4>November 22, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 22, 2025 at 9:09 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President-elect Donald Trump faced a turbulent week characterized by economic shifts and staff upheavals. The September jobs report, delayed due to the shutdown, revealed that unemployment has ticked up to 4.4 percent, the highest level since late 2021. In an effort to address affordability, Trump has begun rolling back several signature tariffs, including 10 percent duties on food items like beef and coffee, 40 percent tariffs on food from Brazil, and tariffs on Swiss goods following a meeting with a delegation of Swiss executives.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Congress, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will resign her seat in January. Once a staunch Trump ally, Greene has recently broken with the President-elect on foreign policy and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, leading to a public falling out. Trump publicly welcomed her resignation, calling it "great news." Meanwhile, the House voted almost unanimously to release the Epstein files. This legislative move coincided with federal prosecutors coming under scrutiny; a judge criticized the Department of Justice’s handling of the case against former FBI Director James Comey, suggesting government misconduct tainted the grand jury proceedings.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On the legal front, the Supreme Court issued a temporary stay blocking a lower court ruling that had invalidated Texas’ newly drawn congressional map. The lower court had cited impermissible racial gerrymandering, but the Supreme Court's intervention restores the Republican-favored map for the time being. In North Carolina, confusion reigned as Customs and Border Protection agents conducted operations in Charlotte and Durham without informing local officials, leading to hundreds of arrests and widespread fear in immigrant communities. Additionally, the Trump administration signaled a shift in health policy, with incoming HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stating he instructed the CDC to remove language asserting that vaccines do not cause autism, a move contested by GOP Senator Bill Cassidy.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a surprising political development, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House. Despite previously exchanging insults—with Mamdani calling Trump a "despot" and Trump labeling Mamdani a "lunatic"—the meeting was described as cordial. Trump praised Mamdani as a "rational person" and expressed interest in helping with the mayor-elect's housing agenda, while Mamdani stood by his policy positions but focused on areas of potential cooperation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Current Mayor Eric Adams will break with tradition by canceling the annual holiday party at Gracie Mansion before leaving office. In the borough of Yonkers, Mayor Mike Spano is positioning his city as an alternative for businesses wary of the incoming New York City administration's policies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In criminal justice news, federal prosecutors filed court papers defending their decision to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of assassinating the UnitedHealthcare CEO. Tragedy struck at Rikers Island where Edwin Ramos, a detainee set to be released on a plea deal within hours, died after suffering an apparent seizure. Additionally, Nechemya Weberman, an unlicensed therapist serving a 103-year sentence for sexual abuse, may see his sentence commuted to a shorter term with support from the Brooklyn District Attorney.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Longtime Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez has announced she will retire from Congress, signaling a generational shift in New York's delegation. Governor Kathy Hochul is reportedly preparing for a challenging reelection bid, strategizing on how to navigate the evolving political landscape.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Tensions are high in Eastern Europe as the White House presented a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. The proposal reportedly involves Kyiv ceding the Donbas region to Russia and foregoing NATO membership. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation as "one of the most difficult moments in our history" as he faces an ultimatum to accept the terms by Thanksgiving. European allies are scrambling to coordinate support for Ukraine amidst these new pressures.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Latin America, the U.S. Navy has positioned assets in the Caribbean, a move analysts interpret as increased pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. This strategy has potential political implications for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose future may depend on the success of the campaign to unseat the Venezuelan strongman.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Across the Atlantic, the British government is introducing legislation to crack down on ticket scalping. The new laws, supported by major artists like Coldplay and Radiohead, would make it illegal to resell event tickets for more than their face value.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The film adaptation of "Wicked," titled "Wicked: For Good," has arrived with new songs added for character development, though critics note the division of the story into two parts leaves some plot threads unresolved. In the literary world, a 30-year project by a novelist to chronicle a single day across seven parts has finally been completed, creating a sensation. Meanwhile, the investigation into a 450-pound pallet of returned goods revealed the massive scale of waste in the modern shopping ecosystem.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Scientific researchers have made several fascinating discoveries. A study of *Physcomitrium patens* moss revealed that its spores can survive exposure to the vacuum of space for over 200 days and still successfully reproduce upon returning to Earth. In the animal kingdom, a gruesome behavior was documented in certain ant species where parasitic queens spray acid on the host queen, tricking the worker ants into killing their own mother. Planetary scientists also released findings suggesting that Theia, the Mars-sized body that collided with Earth to form the Moon, likely originated in the inner solar system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In archaeology, a 12,000-year-old clay figurine discovered in Israel depicts a woman with a goose on her back, marking an early symbolic representation of human-animal interaction. On the technology front, Netflix has opened a permanent immersive location in Philadelphia featuring experiences based on its hit shows.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As the holiday season begins, travelers should be aware of a series of storms moving across the country that could complicate Thanksgiving transit. For those feeling overwhelmed by the season, experts suggest pushing optional social engagements to January to manage stress. In the sports world, Gotham F.C. is set to face the Washington Spirit in the NWSL final after an impressive playoff run.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jamelle Bouie writes in The New York Times that the Trump administration is engaged in a "war of attrition" against American institutions and public opinion, comparing the political dynamic to the Confederacy's need for speed and aggression during the Civil War. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/opinion/trump-administration-civil-war-analogy.html">Trump is mired in a war of attrition</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nick Catoggio argues in The Dispatch that Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation and rebellion over the Epstein files marks the first time the populist base has successfully challenged Trump's authority, potentially setting a precedent for future dissent. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/marjorie-taylor-greene-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein/">The pushback from the right that got us here</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kevin Williamson observes in The Dispatch that Trump's decision to roll back tariffs acknowledges a reality he often ignores: that making goods more expensive hurts affordability, a lesson perhaps accelerated by Swiss diplomacy. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/wanderland/trump-tariffs-debt-rolex-bribery/">Trump has rolled back 10 percent duties</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Errol Louis opines in New York Magazine that the biggest fear for critics of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is not his failure, but the possibility that he might succeed in governing effectively despite his radical platform. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/zohran-mamdanis-next-act.html">The secret fear of the loudest die-hard critics of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Dr. Michelle Morse argues in City & State NY that federal funding cuts are forcing the government to abandon its responsibility to maintain public health, increasing risks for chronic diseases among New Yorkers. <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/opinion/2025/11/opinion-i-am-new-york-citys-doctor-how-we-treat-chronic-disease/409721/">Opinion: I am New York City’s doctor.
