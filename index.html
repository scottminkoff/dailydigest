    <div class="content"><h4>November 24, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook: A pivotal week for the war in Ukraine began with confusion over a U.S.-proposed peace plan that is highly favorable to Russia. After the plan, which President Trump gave Ukraine until Thanksgiving to accept, was leaked, Secretary of State Marco Rubio flew to Geneva for negotiations. A bipartisan group of senators claimed Rubio told them the plan was actually a Moscow-penned wishlist, a claim Rubio and the State Department denied. After a day of talks with Ukrainian officials, Rubio described the meetings as productive and said progress was made, a shift in tone from the White House's previous pressure on Kyiv. Trump has since said the proposal is "not my final offer."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) announced she will resign from Congress, effective January 6, 2026, following public attacks from former President Donald Trump. In a video, Greene stated she wanted to avoid a "hurtful and hateful primary against me." Trump had posted on Truth Social that "Marjorie went BAD," calling her a "traitor," though he later told reporters she is a "nice person." Greene has said she has no intention of launching a presidential campaign.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing for a vote by the end of the year on the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would ban members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. The bill would still permit investments in diversified mutual funds and ETFs. While there is broad public support for such a ban, similar efforts have failed in the past, and some lawmakers remain skeptical it will pass the Senate even if it clears the House.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark: The Trump administration is highlighting a major Affordable Care Act fraud case, in which two men were convicted of triggering about $180 million in federal payments, to strengthen its case against the ACA. Critics argue this focus on "Obamacare fraud" is being used to justify cuts and letting subsidies expire, while ignoring other endemic forms of health insurance fraud, such as the marketing of private plans with limited benefits that leave consumers with massive medical bills.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook: Democrats in Texas are increasingly optimistic about their chances in the 2026 midterm elections, even if a Republican-drawn gerrymandered map stands. Strategists believe they can flip seats based on "Latino buyer's remorse" alone, pointing to recent Democratic wins in Latino-dominated counties in Virginia and New Jersey as evidence of a shifting electorate from 2024. The party sees an opportunity in the three majority-Latino districts in South Texas that the GOP has targeted for pickups.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State New York: Seven years after her election, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has learned to navigate Washington's inside game and is reportedly considering a future run for the Senate or the presidency.</p>
<ul><li>City & State New York: <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42695932.15998/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjUvMTEvMjIvYWxleGFuZHJpYS1vY2FzaW8tY29ydGV6LXNlbmF0ZS1wcmVzaWRlbnQtZGVtb2NyYXRzLz9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fCd37bf960">How AOC learned to play the inside game</a></li></ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: The Federalist Society, which was instrumental in helping President Trump select conservative judges during his first term, is now internally divided. The conflict stems from Trump's demands for loyalty and favorable rulings, which clashes with the group's legal philosophy, particularly after some Trump-appointed judges did not rule in his favor on key issues.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued a temporary ruling allowing Texas to use its new redistricting proposal for the 2026 midterm elections. The decision reverses a lower court's finding that the map was racially discriminatory and allows the map to be used pending a full merits case on its constitutionality.</p>
<ul><li>The Dispatch: <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/11/texas-asks-supreme-court-to-allow-it-to-use-redistricting-map-struck-by-lower-court-as-racially-discriminatory/">Texas asks Supreme Court to allow it to use redistricting map struck by lower court as racially discriminatory</a></li></ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: An FBI investigation into the July 2024 assassination attempt against Donald Trump in Pennsylvania concluded that the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, acted alone. The finding came after what was described as an unprecedented global investigation.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO New York Playbook: New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is resetting political expectations with a series of surprising moves, including a friendly Oval Office meeting with President Trump, retaining moderate-backed NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, and discouraging a progressive primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The democratic socialist is signaling a pragmatic approach focused on building broad alliances to tackle the city's affordability crisis, even with would-be political adversaries.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State New York: The retirement of Rep. Nydia Velázquez after 16 terms has set off a competitive primary to succeed her in a leftist district covering parts of Brooklyn and Queens. The race is expected to draw a wave of progressive and democratic socialist candidates looking to capitalize on the momentum from Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's victory in the same area.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: A Times analysis of records and interviews reveals that abusive treatment of incarcerated people by New York prison guards is rising and becoming more vicious. The report shows some inmates have been restrained and asphyxiated, countering claims from guards that they are using more force only because their jobs have become more dangerous.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State New York: Former advisers and aides of Andrew Cuomo described the former governor as a tragic figure whose downfall was caused by the same pride and ambition that fueled his rise to power, viewing his political ascent as inevitable until it wasn't.</p>
<ul><li>City & State New York: <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42695932.15998/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2l0eWFuZHN0YXRlbnkuY29tL3BlcnNvbmFsaXR5LzIwMjUvMTEvYW5kcmV3LWN1b21vLXdhcy1pbmV2aXRhYmxlLXVudGlsLWhlLXdhc250LzQwOTcyNC8_b3JlZj1jc25ueV9maXJzdHJlYWRfbmw/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fC41848d98">Andrew Cuomo was inevitable. Until he wasn’t.</a></li></ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO New York Playbook: New York Comptroller Tom DiNapoli noted that state revenue is coming in faster than expected, aided by a strong Wall Street. However, he warned that the state has not yet felt the full impact of federal spending cuts and that tax hikes may still be necessary to fund Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's agenda, a possibility Governor Hochul has also acknowledged.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Times Union: U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is running for governor, has repeatedly called NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani a "jihadist." President Donald Trump publicly disagreed with this characterization following his meeting with Mamdani, stating Stefanik was just "out there campaigning."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State New York: The Grieving Families Act, which would change New York’s wrongful death statute to allow families to recover damages for emotional suffering, has passed the Legislature and is once again on Gov. Kathy Hochul's desk. The governor has vetoed the bipartisan bill three times previously.</p>
<ul><li>City & State New York: <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42695932.15998/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jb20vbG9uZy1pc2xhbmQvcG9saXRpY3MvZ3JpZXZpbmctZmFtaWxpZXMtYWN0LW5lZ2xpZ2VuY2UtbGF3c3VpdHMtaXJxbWhqbmg_b3JlZj1jc255X2ZpcnN0cmVhZF9ubA/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fCe447e1fd">Wrongful death bill again in hands of Gov. Kathy Hochul</a></li></ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) killed Hezbollah’s military chief of staff, Haytham Tabatabai, in a targeted airstrike in Beirut. The IDF also conducted strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing at least five senior Hamas members after claiming Hamas militants violated the ongoing truce by firing on Israeli soldiers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a cabinet meeting to address rising violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gary Rosenblatt's "Between The Lines": An anti-Israel protest was held outside Manhattan's Park East Synagogue during an event promoting aliyah, with activists chanting threats and attempting to intimidate attendees. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's subsequent statement was criticized for being more critical of the synagogue than the protesters, as he suggested "sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law," an accusation the author calls an "alibi for bigotry."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jewish Currents: The Israeli right is reportedly capitalizing on the aftermath of October 7th to advance plans for a permanent "humanitarian" transfer of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook: The U.S. is ramping up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with Joint Chiefs Chair Dan Caine visiting the naval fleet sent to the Caribbean to combat "drug trafficking." The visit coincides with a new State Department designation of the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, with Maduro named as its head. This move, strongly pushed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, could lead to new U.S. actions, and a recent report suggests President Trump has signed off on covert action against the Venezuelan government.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: World leaders gathered for the G20 summit in Johannesburg, a meeting President Trump boycotted over his contention that South Africa persecutes its white minority. In the absence of the U.S., other countries reportedly took a tougher tone on Washington during negotiations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: Gunmen in Nigeria are holding 253 students and 12 teachers hostage following an attack on a Catholic school. Initially, 303 children were taken, but 50 escaped. Pope Leo XIV has called for the hostages' immediate release, and many public schools in the region have been temporarily closed amid the violence.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Slow Boring: A guest essay argues that long copyright terms, currently life-of-the-author-plus-70-years in the U.S., are a hidden cause of cultural stagnation. The essay posits that because art can remain valuable for over a century, a huge industry has emerged to buy, remarket, and relitigate old works—through biopics, sanitized samples, and lawsuits—which diverts investment and attention from new creative endeavors. The author suggests shortening copyright terms or expanding compulsory licensing to foster more innovation.</p>
