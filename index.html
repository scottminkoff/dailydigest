The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments this spring in <i>Barbara v. Trump</i>, a challenge to the administration’s executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. The case contests the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which challengers argue contradicts 125 years of settled legal precedent and the Supreme Court’s 1898 ruling in <i>United States v. Wong Kim Ark</i>. If the administration prevails, the Migration Policy Institute projects that approximately 255,000 U.S.-born children could be denied citizenship annually, potentially leaving many stateless.

The White House social media team published an AI-altered image of activist Nekima Levy Armstrong crying during her arrest, which was quickly debunked by authentic photos showing her composed demeanor. The incident highlights a communications strategy that prioritizes projecting power and humiliating opponents over maintaining credibility or factual accuracy. When confronted about the fabrication, a team member remained defiant, stating, "Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue."

In a break with longstanding public health consensus, the new head of the federal vaccine panel stated that shots against polio and measles should be optional. This recommendation aligns with a broader shift in the administration's approach to science and public health mandates. The statement questions the necessity of these vaccines given modern sanitation levels, despite the historical severity of the diseases.

Republican Representative Blake Moore of Utah joined Democrat Steny Hoyer in a bipartisan statement rebuking President Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland as "needlessly dangerous." Moore, who serves as vice chair of the House Republican Conference, emphasized that while Arctic security is vital, the U.S. does not need to possess Greenland to achieve its goals. Despite his initial criticism, Moore later characterized the president's climbdown on tariffs and military threats as a successful negotiation tactic.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
New York City and State officials have declared states of emergency as a massive winter storm is expected to dump at least 10 inches of snow on the region. Governor Hochul announced the suspension of early voting on Sunday and Monday for upcoming special elections in New York City due to the severe weather. Mayor Zohran Mamdani has assured residents that the city is prepared, promising plowed streets and remote schooling options if necessary.

The "All-Electric Buildings Act," which bans fossil fuel equipment in new construction under seven stories, faces a critical legal test next week at the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. New York State voluntarily paused the law's implementation pending this appeal, which creates tension as the state struggles to meet its broader climate mandates. A ruling striking down the law could bolster Governor Hochul's argument for renegotiating the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act’s emissions targets.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has ordered the NYPD to cut back on overtime spending, signaling the beginning of his campaign promise to eliminate the department's overtime budget. This directive has caused concern among the rank and file, particularly as Mamdani has also been visibly supporting labor strikes elsewhere in the city. The move marks a distinct shift in mayoral management of the police force compared to the previous administration.

Israel is reportedly seeking to restrict the number of Palestinians entering Gaza through the Rafah crossing to ensure that more individuals leave the strip than enter when the border reopens. Sources indicate Israel also plans to establish a military checkpoint inside Gaza near the border to screen all travelers. This comes as the IDF issued evacuation notices to displaced Gazans in areas west of the Yellow Line near Khan Yunis.

European leaders have largely rejected President Trump’s proposed "Board of Peace," with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stating the body's governance structure is incompatible with Germany's constitution. Following the chilly reception, Trump announced he was withdrawing the invitation for Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to join the board. The initiative appears to be shrinking to a core group of nations pressured to resolve the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

In a commentary on Parshat Bo, Rabbi Avigayil Halpern reflects on the plague of darkness as a moment that shifted the Israelites from trying to persuade their oppressors to preparing for liberation. Halpern argues that "faith in exposure"—the belief that showing atrocities will stop them—is limited, citing the livestreamed violence in Gaza and against immigrants in the U.S. The commentary suggests that creating new ways of acting and relating is necessary when visibility alone fails to enact change.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
President Trump returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos without securing a deal to acquire Greenland, following strong opposition from European leaders. In response to the pushback, the White House had threatened a 10 percent tariff on eight European nations, prompting the EU to suspend a previously announced trade deal and send troops to the island. Trump ultimately de-escalated the situation, ruling out military force and retracting the tariff threat, though he claimed a "framework of a deal" regarding U.S. military bases remains.

President Trump stated that a U.S. naval "armada" is heading toward Iran as he continues to warn Tehran amid anti-government protests. While Trump expressed hope that the force would not need to be used, U.S. officials confirmed the USS Abraham Lincoln and guided-missile destroyers will arrive in the region shortly. Simultaneously, the administration plans to deport 40 Iranians back to their home country as early as Sunday.

A complex deal to secure TikTok's future in the U.S. has closed, with a new entity controlled by U.S. investors like Oracle taking over operations and content moderation. While ByteDance retains a 20% stake, the deal aims to address security concerns by retraining algorithms on U.S. user data under the oversight of investors friendly to the Trump administration. Experts worry this shift may simply trade fears of foreign propaganda for the reality of domestic propaganda aligned with the U.S. government.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The "national conservatism" movement is facing a dead end as President Trump’s "America First" policies alienate key allies like India and Europe. By treating allies as transactional partners or targets for bullying—exemplified by the Greenland dispute and tariffs on India—the administration is proving that a world without a reliable American-led order encourages nations to form blocs against the U.S. rather than embrace independent nationalism. This approach weakens America's ability to project power and leaves the global stage open for adversaries like China and Russia.

The media repeatedly fails in its coverage of Donald Trump by treating his walk-backs of extreme positions as binding policy shifts rather than temporary tactical retreats. By reporting that Trump "ruled out" military force in Greenland after previously threatening it, news outlets sanitize his erratic behavior and obscure the reality that his statements are often ephemeral positioning. This "sane-washing" serves as a coping mechanism for institutions ill-equipped to cover an aspiring authoritarian force.

A robust, decentralized resistance movement has emerged in Minneapolis in response to aggressive ICE operations, with citizens organizing to track federal vehicles and defend community spaces. Unlike previous protests, this movement involves a broad cross-section of the population, including Republicans, and operates without centralized leadership to evade state countermeasures. This grassroots mobilization stands in stark contrast to the perceived inaction of Democratic politicians and business elites.
