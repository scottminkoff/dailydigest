    <div class="content"><h4>December 11, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook reports that President Trump kicked off his "affordability tour" in Pennsylvania with a speech that aides hoped would focus on the economy, though the President frequently veered off-script, at one point calling affordability a "hoax" before correcting himself. The kickoff comes as exclusive polling shows half of Americans find it difficult to pay for food and 55 percent blame the administration for high prices. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson briefed Republicans on potential healthcare policies, but the conference left with no consensus on extending expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to lapse at the end of the month.</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch notes that the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates by 25 basis points in a split 9-3 vote, the most "no" votes for a rate-cut decision since 2019. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged inflation remains above the 2 percent target, attributing the overshoot primarily to tariffs. Additionally, a federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops for immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that the House approved a $900 billion defense bill that codifies much of President Trump's national security agenda, including a provision that would cut Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget by 25 percent unless he releases unedited videos of military boat strikes. The administration also debuted a website for "gold card" visas, which would be available to those paying at least $1 million.</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook PM notes that the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are requesting the FBI hand over files related to six Democratic members of Congress whom Trump has dubbed the “Seditious Six.” Additionally, the DOJ is challenging a court order that limits their access to evidence in their pursuit of a new indictment against former FBI Director James Comey.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State NY reports that New York City Comptroller Brad Lander is officially launching a bid for Congress to challenge Rep. Dan Goldman, a move supported by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Meanwhile, outgoing City Council Member Keith Powers secured the Democratic nomination for the special election to succeed Harvey Epstein in the Assembly.</p>
