<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: A federal district judge dismissed indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed and "had no lawful authority to present the indictment[s]." The judge dismissed both cases without prejudice, which allows the Justice Department to seek new indictments, though the statute of limitations for the charges against Comey has expired.</p>

They argue that the party apparatus has favored establishment-aligned candidates and must instead embrace those willing to challenge corporate interests and defy party orthodoxy.</p>

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced she will resign from Congress, effective January 6, 2026, following public attacks from President Trump.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Atlantic Daily: A recent series of scandals involving lieutenant governors in states like Indiana and Virginia has highlighted the potential risks of the office. The position, which exists in 45 states, often comes with few mandated duties beyond succeeding the governor, leading some to argue that giving ambitious politicians a lofty title with little responsibility is a flawed system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing for a vote on the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would ban members of Congress, their spouses, and dependents from trading individual stocks. The bill, co-sponsored by members from across the ideological spectrum, aims to address concerns about potential insider trading and conflicts of interest, though some members remain skeptical of its chances of passing the Senate.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO New York Playbook: Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is resetting expectations by building alliances with political adversaries.

</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: The New York City Council will not vote this year on pay raises for its members and other local elected officials. The decision came after it was determined that voting on the salary increases in 2025 would violate local law.</p>
