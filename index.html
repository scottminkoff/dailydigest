    <h1>Good morning, Scott</h1>
    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4><p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant escalation of his mass deportation agenda, President Trump has transformed the Department of Homeland Security, diverting resources from efforts to combat child predators and sex trafficking toward immigration enforcement. A Times investigation revealed this shift as the administration began a new immigration crackdown in Charlotte, N.C., and considered using a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants. The department is also using what The Dispatch calls a "nativist pitch" in its recruitment materials, framing its mission as preserving American culture and identity by blocking "globalists who dilute our culture."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The fallout from the recent government shutdown continues. While the Department of Transportation is easing flight cuts at 40 major airports due to improved air traffic controller staffing, the delayed September jobs report will not be released until this coming Thursday. In Congress, some moderate House Republicans are pushing for a deal to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies to avoid premium hikes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump announced he was cutting ties with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his formerly staunch allies, calling her a "ranting lunatic" on Truth Social and signaling support for a primary challenge against her. The break came after Greene recently called for the release of the Justice Department’s files on Jeffrey Epstein and raised concerns about affordability. On the Epstein matter, House Republican leaders plan to hold a vote on Tuesday on a bipartisan bill that would compel the full release of the records. Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead a new investigation into Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The conservative movement is facing internal strife following Tucker Carlson's friendly interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. According to The Dispatch, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts defended Carlson, sparking outrage from staffers. At an all-hands meeting, one longtime scholar reportedly called Carlson's show a "lunatic asylum." The controversy has highlighted a broader identity crisis on the right, with Vice President JD Vance remaining largely quiet on the issue, which some observers see as a tacit victory for Fuentes's "groyper" movement.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In economic policy, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back "reciprocal" tariffs on some agricultural products like beef, tomatoes, and coffee, a move that could alleviate high grocery prices. Separately, The New York Times reports that The Trump Organization is in discussions to bring a Trump-branded property to a major Saudi government-owned real estate development. The news comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Washington next week.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A Federal Reserve governor who stepped down in August repeatedly violated the central bank’s stock trading rules, a federal ethics report found. Also, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally cut federal funding to the University of California system over its claims of antisemitism.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Brooklyn's Democratic Party is aiming to unite its 17-member City Council delegation into a single, influential voting bloc for the upcoming Council speaker race. According to City & State, party leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is working to unify progressives and moderates to avoid the borough getting "the short end of the stick." The front-runners for speaker are considered to be Manhattan's Julie Menin, who has support from Queens leader Rep. Greg Meeks, and Brooklyn's Crystal Hudson, a top pick for progressives.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A judge has temporarily ordered New York City to refrain from entering into a new agreement with Mets owner Steve Cohen regarding the use of Citi Field’s parking lot. The ruling could potentially torpedo Cohen's bid to bring a casino to the Queens location.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is now flowing to the nearly 3 million New Yorkers who rely on it. However, New York Focus reports it could take weeks for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), which helps with winter heating bills, to reopen. In a related story from the Times Union, the federal government's use of county jails in New York to hold detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has surged this year under President Trump's deportation agenda.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other state news, conservationists are again pressing Gov. Kathy Hochul to approve a ban on harvesting horseshoe crabs in state waters after she vetoed a similar measure last year. Meanwhile, officials at Brooklyn Hospital Center are warning that the facility could be forced to shut down by the end of the year if it does not receive state assistance.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's decision to halt all foreign aid and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has had devastating consequences, according to Atul Gawande, a surgeon and former Biden administration official. In an interview with The Bulwark, Gawande stated that an estimated 600,000 people have already died as a result of the cuts, including 400,000 children. The documentary "Rovina's Choice" highlights the human toll, focusing on a Sudanese refugee in Kenya whose daughter suffers from severe malnutrition. Gawande also warned that the dismantling of USAID has hobbled America's global influence and eliminated pandemic prevention surveillance networks that provided a line of sight into potential outbreaks from Russia and China.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration appears to be moving closer to a conflict with Venezuela. According to POLITICO, President Trump said he has "sort of" decided how to proceed after three days of high-level meetings discussing possible military operations. America’s largest aircraft carrier is set to arrive in the Caribbean, and a classified Justice Department brief reportedly describes fentanyl as a potential chemical weapons threat, which could be used to justify military action.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Ukraine, Russia has been fighting for over a year to take the eastern city of Pokrovsk, which is seen as a strategic gateway to the region. A New York Times photojournalist documented the city's transformation from a respite for soldiers to a battleground on the verge of being obliterated. In the latest attacks, Russia pummeled Kyiv with drones and missiles, killing at least six people and targeting the country's power grid as winter approaches.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is planning to meet with chief Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya as the administration monitors the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. Meanwhile, top administration officials are reportedly planning to meet with President Trump to persuade him not to restart nuclear weapons testing. In other news, women in India report that long-term heat exposure is taking a heavy toll on their health and income, and the BBC is facing a crisis over its decision to edit a speech by President Trump.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In media news, the cable channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW this morning. The change, which came after its parent company Versant was spun out from NBC Universal, was part of a reported $20 million effort. Hosts assured viewers that despite the "snazzy new graphics," the channel's mission would remain the same.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT are increasingly being used for medical advice, according to The New York Times. A survey found about one in six adults consults an A.I. bot for health information, citing long wait times and inattentive doctors in the traditional medical system. Users find the bots to be empathetic and accessible, though doctors worry about the potential for inaccurate or incomplete answers. An Oxford study found that participants using chatbots for a medical scenario chose the appropriate next steps less than half the time.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In literary news, David Szalay’s novel "Flesh" has won the prestigious Booker Prize. The book, which tells the story of a young Hungarian man's rise in London, had previously been chosen for Dua Lipa's book club. Sarah Jessica Parker served as a judge for the prize this year, reading 153 books for the role.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Journalist Olivia Nuzzi is speaking out in a new book about the digital tryst with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that upended her career last year. In film, director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" is now on Netflix. According to a review in The Atlantic, the film is a handsome production but feels "inert" despite del Toro's signature compassion for monsters.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Scientists have made a genetic breakthrough by sequencing RNA from the 39,000-year-old remains of a woolly mammoth, by far the oldest on record. The research, reported in 404 Media, also revealed a surprise about the famous mammoth mummy, named Yuka: genetic analysis of its Y chromosome showed it was male, not female as previously believed for years.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn interviews Atul Gawande about the Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID, which Gawande calls one of the cruelest and most senseless acts of the presidency. Gawande argues the halt to foreign aid, gleefully described by Elon Musk as "feeding USAID into the wood chipper," has already led to an estimated 600,000 preventable deaths and made America weaker by eliminating pandemic surveillance systems. <a href="https://thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">Read the full piece in The Bulwark.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch hosted a debate on the Senate filibuster. John McCormack argues that we will miss the filibuster when it's gone, as it forces bipartisanship and provides stability against wild policy swings between administrations. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/">Read the full piece in The Dispatch.</a> In response, Andrew Egger contends the filibuster only weakens an impotent Congress, arguing it no longer produces good outcomes and instead fuels the very gridlock and executive overreach its defenders claim it prevents. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/senate-filibuster-gridlock-conservatives-congress/">Read the full piece in The Dispatch.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in his New York Times newsletter, Jamelle Bouie examines Vice President JD Vance's silence on the controversy surrounding white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Bouie argues that Vance is "groyper adjacent" and that there is little practical difference between Vance's anti-immigrant demagoguery and Fuentes’s vision of a white ethno-state. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html">Read the full piece in The New York Times.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Washington Post's editorial board writes that while the U.S. penny may have been useless, the Trump administration's abrupt decision to kill it was flawed. The board argues that Congress should have been allowed to write legislation for a smoother, less inflationary exit for the coin. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/us-penny-trump.html">Read more via The New York Times.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">For the New York Daily News, Jennifer Scaife of the Correctional Association of New York argues that Gov. Kathy Hochul must close Marcy Correctional Facility, a state prison she describes as being so beset by tragedy and dysfunction that keeping it open would cause more harm than good. <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/11/15/gov-hochul-must-close-this-abusive-state-prison/">Read the full piece in the Daily News.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Also in The New York Times, opinion writer Jean Twenge argues that to improve test scores, schools should ban not just smartphones, but also laptops and tablets in the classroom. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/schools-laptops-tablets-ban.html">Read the full piece in The New York Times.</a></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally fine the University of California system or cut its federal funding.
