    <h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 17, 2025 at 4:22 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 17, 2025.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Donald Trump has reversed his position on the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, stating on Truth Social that House Republicans should vote to release them because "we have nothing to hide." This U-turn comes less than 48 hours before a planned House vote on a bipartisan effort from Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) to release the documents, a vote the White House had previously fought to block. The shift is seen as a victory for Rep. Massie, and the Senate is now considering how to handle the measure. Trump also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate potential links between Epstein and prominent Democrats. The House Oversight Committee released 23,000 documents from the Epstein estate last week, in which, according to The Wall Street Journal's analysis, Trump was mentioned more frequently than any other prominent individual.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is attempting to shift its economic messaging to focus on "affordability" amid polling that shows the cost of living and inflation are top concerns for American voters. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pushed back against claims that prices are rising, stating that purchasing power has increased. In a move to lower grocery prices, President Trump signed an executive order lifting tariffs on a range of imported food products, including beef, coffee, and fruit. He is also expected to deliver a speech on affordability at a McDonald's-hosted summit. Other affordability ideas being floated by the administration include $2,000 rebate checks from tariffs and the introduction of 50-year mortgages.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a separate development, a federal magistrate judge has ruled that "government misconduct," including "fundamental misstatements of the law" by lead prosecutor Lindsey Halligan, may have undermined the Department of Justice's criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey. According to POLITICO, the judge's assessment increases the possibility that the case will be dismissed before trial. In a series of Truth Social posts, President Trump has continued to call for more formal investigations into his political adversaries, including former FBI Director Chris Wray.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">After a weekend of feuding, President Trump weighed in on two issues dividing the MAGA movement: besides the Epstein files, he also offered support for Tucker Carlson following Carlson's controversial interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Trump stated that if Carlson "wants to do it, get the word out," adding that "people have to decide." This stance has become a significant dividing line among conservatives.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on the legality of "metering," a policy that allows immigration officials to turn away some asylum seekers at U.S.-Mexico border crossings. The policy was initiated on a trial basis under the Obama administration.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, David Richardson, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), has resigned. The Federal Aviation Administration has lifted all flight restrictions on 40 major airports that were imposed during the recent government shutdown. President Trump is escalating his conflict with Indiana Republicans who opposed his state redistricting effort, planning a "retributive endorsement" against state Sen. Jim Buck and inviting GOP holdouts to one-on-one meetings at the White House. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is seen as politically vulnerable following the end of the shutdown.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">One of the first major tests for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be whether the Trump administration grants him a top-level security clearance. According to POLITICO, President Trump has previously used clearances as a tool for retribution against political opponents, but denying one to the mayor of New York City would be a significant and unorthodox escalation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul is preparing for a series of political battles, including navigating a wide ideological gap with the newly-elected democratic socialist mayor and dealing with federal budget cuts. The two met last week to discuss legislative priorities. At a rally organized by the Democratic Socialists of America, supporters called on Hochul to back Mamdani's fiscal agenda, including raising taxes on the wealthy to fund universal child care. State Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have introduced the "Fair Share Act," which would raise taxes on households earning over $1 million. However, Steven Fulop, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, called Mamdani's proposed corporate tax hikes "absolute suicide" for the city. Gov. Hochul is reportedly considering a non-income tax hike to fund the mayor-elect's agenda.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mamdani is also facing early friction with some political allies. The New York Times reports he has privately told City Council Member Alexa Avilés that he would support former Comptroller Brad Lander in a potential primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman. This move has irked members of the NYC-DSA, which has endorsed Avilés for the same race. In his transition, Mamdani has affirmed his plan to keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner, a decision that has received mixed reactions from police officers.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Albany, the state has agreed to delay the implementation of its all-electric buildings law pending a court case. Gov. Hochul is also calling on the Trump administration to release federal heat assistance funds, which remain uncertain after the government shutdown. A bill to end a subsidy for new gas hookups was the most lobbied legislation in the state over the summer, according to preliminary data.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The state Gaming Facility Location Board is conducting site visits for the three remaining applicants for a downstate casino license: Bally’s in the Bronx, and Resorts World and Metropolitan Park in Queens. A judge has temporarily halted a new agreement over the use of Citi Field's parking lot, which could jeopardize the Mets owners' bid to build a casino there.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State released its "2025 Women Power 100" list, which includes Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is positioning herself as a front-runner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, and 1199SEIU President Yvonne Armstrong, who recently won a major union election upset.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, Assembly Member Stacy Pheffer-Amato will not seek reelection. Longtime lobbyist and former aide to Mayor John Lindsay, Sid Davidoff, has died at 86.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the security failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, opting against a traditional state commission of inquiry. This comes after Israel's High Court of Justice stated there was "no real argument" against forming a state commission.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.N. Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution concerning Gaza that leaves open the possibility of Palestinian statehood. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Israel’s opposition to an independent Palestinian state. In a separate diplomatic development, Axios reports that the Israeli government is not opposed to a potential Saudi Arabian purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets, provided that Saudi Arabia agrees to normalize relations with Israel.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-day trip to Israel, which is being billed as a farewell visit and a show of solidarity amid rising antisemitism. He is scheduled to meet with top government officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">British politics is facing a period of significant fragmentation, with both the governing Labour Party, under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and the opposition Conservative Party languishing below 20% in the polls. According to The Dispatch, economic stagnation and public anger over high immigration rates are fueling a surge in support for the right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, which is now polling at 29%. Reform's platform includes radically restrictionist immigration policies that threaten to supplant the Conservatives as the main party of the right. The turmoil could lead to a five-party contest in the next general election.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump said he may have discussions with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, even as the U.S. increases its military presence in the Caribbean. The USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, has arrived in the region, bringing the U.S. troop presence to about 15,000. In a related event, the Defense Department confirmed that a U.S. airstrike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel in the Caribbean last week killed all four people aboard.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced efforts to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia. He is also "rebooting" the country's energy sector following corruption scandals. His moves come as Russia launched new missile and drone strikes on Kharkiv and Kyiv, killing at least nine people.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Chile's presidential election will proceed to a runoff in December between right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast and Communist Party member Jeannette Jara. Kast is considered the favorite after right-leaning candidates collectively won 70% of the vote in the first round.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other global news, the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a peace deal with the M23 armed rebel group. The United Kingdom announced reforms to its asylum program, reducing the duration of refugee status. China has advised its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly sparked a significant online controversy after stating on her show that a source close to the Jeffrey Epstein case told her Epstein was not a pedophile but was "into the barely legal type," like 15-year-old girls. This prompted backlash from commentators like John Oliver, who accused her of "pedophile math," and a violent joke from comedian Patton Oswalt on the social media platform Bluesky, which led to his temporary suspension. The incident has renewed discussions around the technical definitions of terms like pedophilia versus ephebophilia, which refers to attraction to adolescents.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York is poised to pass the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, which would establish new regulations for major AI companies. In response, a new pro-AI super PAC, Leading the Future, announced it is launching a multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat the bill's co-sponsor, Assemblymember Alex Bores, in his congressional primary race.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The first part of Ken Burns' new documentary on the American Revolution debuted on PBS. Netflix also released "Death by Lightning," a new four-part drama about the assassination of President James Garfield.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system over allegations of antisemitic civil rights violations. The judge's order blocks the government from attempting to wrest a $1.2 billion settlement from UCLA or denying federal grants to its researchers.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data shows that the decline in international student enrollment in U.S. colleges began before the Trump presidency. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, foreign enrollment saw a 7% drop last fall, precipitated by waning interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures suggest the trend will worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In California, a new "antisemitism prevention" law is being analyzed by some as part of a broader campaign against ethnic studies curricula. According to Jewish Currents, the law ironically may make it more difficult for educators to engage with the shifting conditions of modern Jewish identity.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias argues that the group of Democratic senators who ended the recent government shutdown should not be described as "moderates." He contends that true moderation involves aligning with public priorities and majority opinion on substantive issues. In this case, he writes, the senators prioritized inside-baseball policy outcomes—like protecting federal workers' pay and securing higher appropriations levels—over engaging in a politically advantageous fight with President Trump, even if that fight caused short-term public hardship. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">For the Daily News, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Jamie Beran of Bend the Arc: Jewish Action write that amid rising antisemitism and authoritarianism, the Jewish community must confront deep tensions about what it means to be Jewish in the era of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42570141.34601/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTYvem9ocmFuLW1hbWRhbmktYW5kLW55Y3MtamV3cy13aGF0LWtpbmQtb2YtamV3aXNoLWNvbW11bml0eS1kby13ZS13YW50LXRvLWJlLz9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fCe6649ec9">https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42570141.34601/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTYvem9ocmFuLW1hbWRhbmktYW5kLW55Y3MtamV3cy13aGF0LWtpbmQtb2YtamV3aXNoLWNvbW11bml0eS1kby13ZS13YW50LXRvLWJlLz9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fCe6649ec9</a></p>
