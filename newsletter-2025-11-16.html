<h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump announced he was cutting ties with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her a "ranting lunatic" on Truth Social and signaling support for a primary challenge. The break followed Greene's recent calls for the release of the Justice Department’s files on Jeffrey Epstein and criticism of the president's handling of the matter. Greene responded on X by posting screenshots of her texts to Trump and labeling his attack as an effort to "scare all the other Republicans." The House is expected to vote on Tuesday on bipartisan legislation that would force the full release of all Epstein-related records from the DOJ. In a related move, President Trump ordered the Justice Department to investigate ties between Epstein and prominent Democrats, assigning Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to the probe.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, the Department of Transportation is lowering flight cuts at 40 major airports to three percent, reflecting improvements in air traffic controller staffing. Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is now flowing again to recipients after a period described by officials as a "nail-biting scramble." However, funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps with winter heating bills, could take weeks to reopen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Heritage Foundation is experiencing internal turmoil after its president, Kevin Roberts, defended Tucker Carlson's recent friendly interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. In an all-hands meeting, some Heritage scholars expressed outrage, with one calling Carlson's show a "lunatic asylum." The controversy has highlighted a broader divide on the right, with Vice President JD Vance remaining quiet on the issue. According to The New York Times, Vance is seen as "groyper adjacent," and Fuentes has interpreted his silence as a political victory, suggesting the Vice President fears the consequences of a disavowal.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times investigation found that the Trump administration has transformed the Department of Homeland Security to carry out its mass deportation campaign, diverting resources from efforts to combat child predators, sex trafficking, and black market sales. As part of a new crackdown, Border Patrol agents began arresting people across Charlotte, N.C., this weekend. The agency's recruiting materials are also reportedly taking on a nativist tone, with one official stating that a key task is "defending our culture and what it means to be an American."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other political news, a Federal Reserve governor who stepped down in August was found to have repeatedly violated the central bank’s stock trading rules, according to a federal ethics report. In Indiana, the Republican-led state Senate has declared it will not convene to redraw congressional maps, a significant blow to the White House's efforts to shore up the GOP House majority through redistricting.</p>

According to City & State, Brooklyn Democratic Party Leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn and other members are working to consolidate their influence to avoid getting the "short end of the stick" as they have in past elections.

Separately, the use of county jails in New York by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has surged this year as part of President Trump's broader deportation agenda.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Brooklyn Hospital Center is at risk of closure by the end of the year if it does not receive financial assistance from the state. Elected officials are sounding the alarm and urging Gov. Kathy Hochul to intervene to prevent a shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In an interview with The Bulwark, writer and surgeon Dr. Atul Gawande discussed the devastating human toll of the Trump administration's decision to halt foreign aid and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Gawande, a former Biden administration official, stated that the cuts have already led to an estimated 600,000 deaths, with 400,000 of them being children. A new documentary he produced with The New Yorker, "Rovina's Choice," chronicles the consequences of these policies by following a Sudanese refugee in Kenya struggling to get aid for her malnourished child. Gawande noted that modern food assistance programs had previously dropped mortality rates from severe malnutrition from over 20% to under 5%.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump told reporters that he has "sort of" decided how to move forward on Venezuela but did not offer specifics.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to a New York Times report, a growing number of patients are turning to A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice. Users cited long wait times, inattentive doctors, and high costs as reasons for seeking an alternative. Many reported that the bots offer an accessible and empathetic "bedside manner" that they feel is lacking in the traditional healthcare system. While some doctors acknowledged the system's flaws, they also expressed concern that patients are relying on a technology known to provide incomplete or fabricated answers for high-stakes health decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Scientists have successfully sequenced RNA from the 39,000-year-old remains of a woolly mammoth. The genetic material was sourced from a well-preserved mummy known as Yuka, making it the oldest RNA ever recorded by approximately 25,000 years.

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jamelle Bouie, writing for The New York Times, argues that Vice President JD Vance is "groyper adjacent" for refusing to condemn neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes after his interview with Tucker Carlson. Bouie contends there is little practical difference between Vance's anti-immigrant rhetoric and Fuentes's vision of a white ethno-state, and that Vance fears the political consequences of an open disavowal. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html</a></p>
