    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A significant intra-party feud has erupted between former President Donald Trump and one of his staunchest allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. The conflict appears centered on Greene's push for the full release of the Justice Department's files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has lashed out at Greene on Truth Social, calling her a "traitor," a "ranting lunatic," and signaling support for a primary challenge against her. In an interview on CNN, Greene called Trump's words "hurtful" and dangerous, stating they could radicalize people against her. She affirmed her support for Trump's agenda but maintained her push for transparency on the Epstein files.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Meanwhile, the House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on legislation from Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna that would compel the full release of the Epstein records. Massie predicted a "deluge" of Republican support, warning colleagues that a vote against it would be remembered as a vote to "protect pedophiles." Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that Trump is not worried about the files' release. In a related development, Attorney General Pam Bondi has tasked Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton with leading a new investigation into Epstein after Trump demanded a probe into prominent Democrats.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's focus on immigration continues to have broad effects. A New York Times investigation found that the Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of agents from their regular duties—slowing down probes into child predators, sex trafficking, and black-market Iranian oil sales—to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants. This crackdown is now visible in Charlotte, N.C., where masked Border Patrol agents began arresting people this weekend, prompting protests. The next target for a similar operation, dubbed "Catahoula Crunch," will be New Orleans. In a separate development, newly released financial disclosures reveal that Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise departure in August came as she was being investigated for breaking ethics rules by trading individual stocks.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, funding for the SNAP program has resumed. In Congress, some moderate House Republicans are now pushing for a deal to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies to avoid premium hikes. On the economic front, recently released disclosures show that former President Trump has purchased at least $82 million in bonds since late August. His family business, The Trump Organization, is also reportedly in talks for a branded property in a major Saudi government real estate development overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is scheduled to visit Washington next week.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The covert race for New York City Council speaker is intensifying, with Brooklyn's 17-member delegation, the council's largest, attempting to unify as a single voting bloc to maximize its influence. According to City & State, Brooklyn Democratic Party Leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is working to unite both progressive and moderate members. Front-runners for the speakership include Julie Menin, who has support from Queens and the Bronx, and Crystal Hudson, a top choice for progressives.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Queens, a judge has temporarily blocked New York City from entering into a new agreement with Mets owner Steve Cohen regarding the use of Citi Field's parking lot. The ruling could potentially derail Cohen's bid to build a casino on the site. Separately, the Trump administration has explored using a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island as a potential site to hold detained immigrants as it seeks to escalate roundups in the city.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Statewide, officials at the Brooklyn Hospital Center are warning that the facility could be forced to shut down by the end of the year if it does not receive a rescue package from Gov. Kathy Hochul. Conservationists are also renewing their push for the governor to sign a bill banning the harvesting of horseshoe crabs, a measure she vetoed last year. Finally, though federal funding for SNAP benefits has resumed after the shutdown, the lapse caused what the NYC Department of Social Services Commissioner called an "entirely avoidable" and "nail-biting scramble" for the nearly 3 million New Yorkers who rely on the program.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's decision to halt global assistance and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has had devastating consequences, according to a report in The Bulwark. An infectious disease modeling team estimates that 600,000 people, including 400,000 children, have already died due to the cuts in aid for food, HIV medication, and other essentials. A new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," produced with The New Yorker, follows a Sudanese refugee in Kenya struggling with her daughter's severe malnutrition, highlighting the human toll of the policy shift.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other foreign policy developments, former President Trump told reporters he has "sort of" decided how to move forward on Venezuela following several days of high-level meetings about potential military operations. These discussions have included Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. A classified Justice Department brief reportedly describes fentanyl as a potential chemical weapons threat, which is being used as part of the justification for military boat strikes in the Caribbean.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Russia has continued its assault on Ukraine, pummeling Kyiv with drones and missiles in recent days. The attacks have increasingly targeted Ukraine's power grid in an apparent effort to cause widespread blackouts as winter approaches. Elsewhere, women in India report that long-term heat exposure in their homes and workplaces is taking a heavy toll on both their health and their income.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Patients are increasingly turning to A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, citing long waits for appointments, inattentive doctors, and high costs. According to The New York Times, users appreciate the bots' encyclopedic knowledge and empathetic, agreeable tone. However, medical professionals worry about the technology's tendency to provide incomplete or fabricated answers for high-stakes health decisions, creating a complex new dynamic in the doctor-patient relationship.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In media, the cable news channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW this morning. The name change, part of a reported $20 million effort, comes as the network faces a significant decline in viewership and increased competition from podcasts and online streaming platforms. The network hopes to remain nimble in a splintering media ecosystem.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a setback for the autonomous vehicle industry, driverless taxis in San Francisco are facing new scrutiny after one of the vehicles killed a beloved local cat. Meanwhile, a new Netflix adaptation of "Frankenstein" from director Guillermo del Toro is being described by critics as visually handsome but emotionally inert.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a scientific breakthrough, researchers have successfully sequenced RNA from the 39,000-year-old remains of a woolly mammoth, by far the oldest on record. The study, published in Cell, also revealed a surprise: the famed mammoth mummy, named Yuka, had been misidentified for years as female but is, in fact, male.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Michelle Cottle argues that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' fatal flaw is that he is too unobjectionable. She writes that he "comes across as too smooth, too reasonable, too benign to cut a compelling opposition figure in the Trump era." <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark's Jonathan Cohn details the human toll of the Trump administration's dismantling of foreign aid. In a conversation with Dr. Atul Gawande, Cohn describes the halt of USAID funding for food and medicine as possibly the "cruelest, most senseless thing Trump has done," leading to an estimated 600,000 deaths. <a href="https://thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">https://thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in his New York Times newsletter, Jamelle Bouie observes that Vice President JD Vance is "functionally 'groyper adjacent'" for remaining quiet on the controversy surrounding Tucker Carlson's friendly interview with neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes. Bouie argues that Vance fears the political consequences of a disavowal and instead deploys anti-immigrant demagoguery that is practically indistinct from Fuentes's vision. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/jd-vance-nick-fuentes.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonah Goldberg of The Dispatch argues that while postliberals and nationalists on the right may disavow white nationalist Nick Fuentes, their intellectual movements contributed to his rise. Goldberg writes that they "all swam in the same waters and share a lot of intellectual and political DNA," creating an environment where the "groyper" movement could fester. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jean Twenge, in The New York Times, makes the case that to improve test scores, schools should not only ban smartphones but also laptops and tablets, which she argues are just as distracting for students. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/schools-laptops-test-scores.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/schools-laptops-test-scores.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch featured a debate on the filibuster. John McCormack argues that we will miss the legislative tool when it's gone, as it forces compromise and prevents wild partisan swings in policy. Andrew Egger counters that the filibuster no longer encourages bipartisanship and only serves to weaken an already "impotent Congress." <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/">https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/</a> and <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/senate-filibuster-gridlock-conservatives-congress/">https://thedispatch.com/debates/senate-filibuster-gridlock-conservatives-congress/</a></p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees has taken the unprecedented step of formally voting down the nomination of Maria Conzatti to lead Nassau Community College. The move escalates a fight over the college's leadership that has lasted more than three years. In a separate matter, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally fine the University of California system or cut its federal funding over the administration's claims of antisemitism and discrimination on its campuses.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">After 232 years, the American penny has been officially discontinued by the U.S. government. In astronomical news, the Leonids meteor shower is set to reach its peak tonight, and a mostly dark moon should provide excellent viewing conditions for stargazers. A recent scientific review highlights the critical role of beavers as "ecosystem engineers" in combating climate change. Their dams create biodiverse, fire-resistant wetlands that increase water storage and improve overall environmental resilience.</p>
