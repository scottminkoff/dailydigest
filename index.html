Vicente Gonzalez predicts South Texas will flip "completely blue" in the next cycle, citing potential "buyer's remorse" among Latino voters who supported Republicans in 2024.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has announced convictions in a major fraud case involving two men who enrolled homeless individuals in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to collect commissions. Administration officials, including Mehmet Oz, are using this case to argue for changes to ACA subsidies.
