Mark Cuban is advocating for a healthcare system overhaul that maintains private employers but increases government coverage for costs citizens cannot afford. Despite his independent streak, Cuban expressed a willingness to work with the Trump administration to lower drug prices through transparency measures like those used at his company, Cost Plus Drugs.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Incoming NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani is finalizing his cabinet, tapping Manhattan Superintendent Kamar Samuels for Schools Chancellor and retaining several Adams administration officials for continuity.

The future of NYC's Office to Combat Antisemitism and its director, Moshe Davis, remains unclear as Mayor-elect Mamdani prepares to take office. Davis, who has led the office for eight months, plans to report for work despite receiving no communication from the incoming administration regarding his employment status. The uncertainty raises questions about how the new administration, led by a mayor who has been critical of Israel, will approach the specific mandate of combating antisemitism.

Republicans filed an amended complaint challenging New York’s even-year election law, arguing that Zohran Mamdani’s election in an odd year proves that local races get overshadowed in even years. The lawsuit contends that the law disadvantages minority-party expression by submerging local issues beneath high-profile federal contests, citing Mamdani's ability to campaign on local issues as a "relevant nonparty" example. The suit also added the State Board of Elections as a defendant.

Several performers have canceled scheduled appearances at the Kennedy Center to protest the renaming of the venue to include President Trump's name.

Despite predictions that digital reading would take over, physical paper books accounted for 707 million sales this year, representing three-quarters of the market. This data suggests that readers have largely rejected a full transition to e-books in favor of traditional formats. The endurance of print challenges early tech industry assumptions about consumer behavior in the publishing world.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Jerusalem Demsas argues that while liberals champion political equality, they are often comfortable with the authoritarian nature of childhood, revealing a tension in modern parenting philosophy. Polling data shows 62% of voters oppose students using bathrooms differing from their sex assigned at birth, highlighting a cross-class consensus on strong parental rights. Demsas suggests that the dependency inherent in childhood naturally leads to a "benevolent dictatorship," challenging the application of broad liberal rights to minors.

Nick Catoggio argues that the artist boycott of the "Trump Kennedy Center" is unlikely to shame the president but serves a vital purpose in stigmatizing the "quasi-monarchy" he is attempting to build. He contends that while the boycott may not force a name change, it denies Trump the cultural validation he seeks and signals that the social cost of his actions is too high for many Americans. Catoggio concludes that "stigmatizing illegal behavior will do in a pinch when it can’t be strictly prohibited."
