The Senate has passed a bipartisan spending package to fund the majority of the government through September, though a partial shutdown has technically begun as the House waits to vote on the measure. The deal includes a temporary two-week extension for the Department of Homeland Security, allowing lawmakers time to debate contentious immigration reforms following the fatal shooting of two residents by federal agents in Minnesota. The brief funding lapse is expected to have minimal immediate impact, though House Speaker Mike Johnson hopes to pass the legislation quickly upon the chamber's return.

The Department of Justice has reversed course and opened a civil rights investigation into the killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis, while former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested while covering related protests. This comes as an internal memo revealed that ICE has granted agents broader authority to arrest individuals without warrants if they are deemed "likely to escape," a move that has drawn sharp criticism from federal judges. The escalating tensions have led to the removal of Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino from his duties in Minneapolis, replaced by border czar Tom Homan who has pledged to reduce agent presence.

President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor, to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair when Powell’s term expires in May. Additionally, Trump has tapped career staffer Brett Matsumoto to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, filling a vacancy left after the previous head was fired over negative jobs numbers. This leadership overhaul signals a significant shift in the administration's approach to economic data and monetary policy management.

The death toll from the frigid weather and snowstorm in New York City has risen to 13, intensifying scrutiny on Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s handling of his administration's first major crisis. Concurrently, Governor Kathy Hochul is reportedly frustrated with Mamdani's "tax the rich" rhetoric as he warns of a $12 billion budget hole for the city.

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed over 30 Palestinians on Saturday, with the IDF stating the targets were Hamas and Islamic Jihad members involved in a ceasefire violation. This escalation occurred just as the U.S. approved four arms sales packages to Israel worth approximately $6 billion, a move criticized by top House Democrats for bypassing standard review processes. Despite the violence, Moody's has raised Israel's credit outlook to "stable" from "negative," citing reduced security risks following the ceasefire.

The media's obsession with prediction markets like Polymarket is coming under scrutiny as concerns rise that America is "slow-walking" into a disaster with these platforms.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Financial markets are showing a surprising resilience to President Trump's erratic policy announcements, suggesting investors are becoming inured to his chaos. Despite shocks like the Venezuela intervention or threats against the Fed Chair, the markets have barely budged, acclimating to a pattern where Trump often overpromises and underdelivers. Economists warn, however, that financial markets remain in the business of pricing threats, and Trump will surely keep them coming.

The Trump administration's "brute-force" approach to power is failing, as evidenced by the galvanized opposition following the heavy-handed ICE tactics in Minneapolis. Arresting journalists like Don Lemon for covering protests is a sign of an unsophisticated vision of power that relies on coercion rather than persuasion, a strategy that is arguably backfiring by alienating the public. This creates a spiral where the administration leans harder on force to save face, eventually revealing the limits of their ability to instill fear.

Conservatives who passionately defend the Second Amendment for figures like Kyle Rittenhouse but ignore the rights of Alex Pretti—a nurse lawfully carrying a firearm who was killed by federal agents—are revealing a deep hypocrisy. Principles such as gun rights, free markets, and elections cannot be selectively applied only when they benefit one's own political "team." If rights are only championed when convenient, they aren't actually principles at all.

President Trump's international policy suggests a desire to return to a 19th-century order of spheres of influence, abandoning the liberal international order the U.S. built. This "America vs. the World" approach will likely leave the United States less prosperous and the entire world less secure. The administration's actions signal a retreat from the strategic alliances that have historically underpinned global stability.
