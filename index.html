The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a ruling allowing the federal government to indefinitely detain non-citizens without bond, adopting a controversial legal theory advanced by the Trump administration. This decision conflicts with rulings from over 300 district court judges who have rejected the administration's interpretation that long-time residents can be classified as "arriving aliens" to deny them due process. Legal scholar Steve Vladeck argues this creates an untenable situation that will force the Supreme Court to intervene to resolve the disparity in how detention laws are applied across the country.

A federal judge has extended an order blocking the Trump administration from withholding billions in funding for social services and infrastructure, specifically allowing the Gateway rail tunnel project between New York and New Jersey to proceed. This judicial intervention comes amid reports that administration officials offered to unfreeze the funds only if Senator Chuck Schumer agreed to rename Penn Station and Dulles Airport after Donald Trump. The order prevents the administration from restricting roughly $10 billion in funding designated for Democratic-led states including New York, California, and Illinois.

Following intense backlash, the White House deleted a racist video posted to President Trump's social media account that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. While the administration initially dismissed the post as a meme about "The Lion King," Republicans including Senator Tim Scott and Rep. Mike Lawler publicly condemned the imagery as offensive and unacceptable. Trump later refused to apologize to reporters, stating, "I didn't make a mistake," while White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt urged the public to stop the "fake outrage."

The Trump administration has signaled a shift in immigration enforcement strategy, announcing a reduction of federal agents in Minnesota following significant protests and a judicial extension of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians. Border czar Tom Homan stated the administration is moving toward "smarter enforcement," though critics argue the initial aggressive sweeps were intended to detain as many people as possible regardless of criminal history. This retreat comes amid reports that senior adviser Stephen Miller has been driving the most aggressive tactics, including the push that led to the shooting death of a nurse in Minneapolis.

While specific details of the probe remain undisclosed, Deputy County Executive James Amenta confirmed the request originated from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York within the last month. This federal scrutiny places the local election board in the crosshairs of a potentially significant legal inquiry.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Three pro-Palestinian films short-listed for the Academy Awards are being criticized for presenting biased historical narratives that frame Israel as a villain. Gary Rosenblatt highlights "The Voice of Hind Rajab," a film about a 5-year-old Gazan girl's death, noting that while it is emotionally powerful, it omits key context regarding Hamas's role in the conflict and presents disputed details as fact. Rosenblatt argues this trend in cinema risks cementing a one-sided view of the war and delegitimizing Israel's existence in the eyes of the global public.

Amazon’s decision to spend $75 million on the "Melania" documentary has intensified criticism of Jeff Bezos amid mass layoffs at The Washington Post. Former Post staffer Carlos Lozada argues that the investment in the film, which has a massive divide between critic and audience scores, suggests Bezos's primary motivation isn't always profit or quality product. The documentary is expected to earn around $14.5 million in its first 10 days, a fraction of its budget.

Scientists are beginning to seriously investigate the medical and ethical challenges of human reproduction in space as commercial spaceflight expands. A new study highlights that space is an inherently hostile environment for terrestrial biology, with risks including cosmic radiation and microgravity that could severely impact fertility and fetal development. Researchers warn that without robust ethical frameworks, we risk "exporting not just life but injustice, exploitation and harm into the cosmos."

Many adult children are unprepared for their aging parents' health crises, often learning about medical issues only after an emergency occurs. Experts advise having difficult conversations early to understand parents' routines, mobility issues, and memory changes before a crisis strikes. Key steps include creating an "in case of emergency" list of medications and doctors, assessing home safety for fall risks, and designating a point person to make medical decisions if parents become incapacitated.

A new study estimates that nearly 40% of cancer cases worldwide in 2022 could have been prevented by eliminating modifiable risk factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and infections. Smoking remains the leading contributor, accounting for over 15% of the cancer burden, followed by infections and alcohol. The research highlights significant gendered patterns, with higher rates of smoking-related cancers in men and higher BMI-related risks in women.

Jamelle Bouie argues that Donald Trump's recent posting of a racist video depicting the Obamas as apes reveals his core motivation: deep-seated racism and chauvinism. Bouie contends that Trump's political career, from birtherism to attacks on birthright citizenship, is driven by a belief in his own superiority based on race rather than accomplishment. He asserts that this incident is the most flagrant display of presidential racism since Woodrow Wilson screened "The Birth of a Nation."

Jesse Singal criticizes Dr. Jonathan Howard for citing a flawed 2023 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> study as "evidence" supporting youth gender medicine in a recent attack on Michael Shermer. Singal argues that the study in question failed to report key variables, showed questionable improvements, and was produced by a team that later admitted to withholding data for political reasons. He contends that prominent doctors damage their credibility when they cite weak or debunked research to support their ideological positions on controversial medical topics.
