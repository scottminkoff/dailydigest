    <div class="content"><h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant reversal, President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to vote in favor of releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, stating on Truth Social, "We have nothing to hide." The turnaround comes just two days before a scheduled vote on a bipartisan measure to release the documents, which the Trump administration had previously fought to block. The push to release the files has created a public rift between Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who championed the effort. Greene told CNN that Trump's subsequent attacks on her, including calling her a "traitor," were "hurtful" and dangerous. Speaker Mike Johnson defended the president, claiming Trump is not worried about the files' release. Trump also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate potential links between Epstein and prominent Democrats, though an analysis of Epstein's emails by The Wall Street Journal found that Trump was mentioned more frequently than those he named.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is attempting to shift its focus to economic issues, framing a recent executive order that lifts tariffs on imported food products like coffee, beef, and bananas as a move to lower grocery prices. The U.S. also finalized a trade deal with Switzerland. However, the administration's "affordability" push has been largely overshadowed by the Epstein controversy and Trump's support for Tucker Carlson's decision to interview white nationalist Nick Fuentes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the aftermath of the recent government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration has lifted all restrictions on commercial flights at 40 major airports. A CBS poll found that 55% of Americans believe Republicans got more of what they wanted from the shutdown deal. The outcome has left Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appearing politically vulnerable, according to POLITICO.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal immigration crackdown has begun in Charlotte, North Carolina, with Border Patrol agents making arrests over the weekend. A New York Times investigation found that the Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of agents from other duties, such as combating child predators and sex trafficking, to focus on immigration enforcement. The next target for a similar operation is reportedly New Orleans.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other political news, Pete Skandalakis, a longtime Georgia prosecutor, will take over the state's election interference case against Trump, replacing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Separately, a U.S. Office of Government Ethics report revealed that former Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August, had made stock purchases that violated the central bank's ethics code.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">One of the first major tests of the relationship between New York City's incoming administration and Washington will be whether President Trump grants Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani a top-level security clearance. According to POLITICO, Trump has previously used the clearance process as a tool for retribution against political opponents, including Attorney General Letitia James and District Attorney Alvin Bragg. A denial would be highly unusual and could complicate coordination between local and federal law enforcement.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is already navigating complex political terrain. He is reportedly at odds with allies like Comptroller Brad Lander and the NYC Democratic Socialists of America over his potential endorsement in the primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman. Meanwhile, Mamdani has expressed confidence in his plan to retain Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner. Hundreds of supporters gathered in Union Square for a rally organized by the NYC-DSA to celebrate Mamdani's victory and urge Governor Kathy Hochul to support his agenda, particularly his plan to tax the wealthy to fund universal child care. However, Steven Fulop, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, called the proposed corporate tax hikes "absolute suicide."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the ongoing race for New York City Council Speaker, the 17-member Brooklyn delegation, led by county boss Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, is looking to vote as a unified bloc to increase its influence. The race is entering a new phase of public forums, with the first taking place tonight at the Whitney Museum.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The state Gaming Facility Location Board is currently visiting the three remaining sites vying for a downstate casino license. However, one of those bids may be in jeopardy after a judge ordered the city to temporarily halt a new agreement over the use of Citi Field's parking lot, a key part of the proposed casino plan by the Mets' owner.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Albany, the state is considering the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Safety and Education (RAISE) Act to regulate AI. A new pro-AI super PAC, backed by over $100 million, has announced it is launching a multimillion-dollar effort to oppose the congressional campaign of the bill's sponsor, Assemblymember Alex Bores.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, rather than forming a traditional state commission of inquiry. The decision comes after the High Court of Justice stated there was "no real argument" against a state inquiry. Separately, Axios reported the Israeli government is not opposed to Saudi Arabia purchasing U.S. F-35 fighter jets, provided it is part of a deal to normalize relations between the two countries.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.N. Security Council is set to vote today on a U.S.-drafted resolution concerning Gaza that leaves open the possibility of Palestinian statehood. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his opposition to an independent Palestinian state. Meanwhile, outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-day trip to Israel, described as both a show of solidarity and a "farewell visit."</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">British politics is experiencing a significant fracture of its two-party system. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party, which won a massive majority just over a year ago, is now in turmoil with a -48% net approval rating. According to The Dispatch, the party has waffled on key issues like taxes and immigration, causing its support to collapse. The Conservative Party has failed to capitalize on Labour's weakness and remains similarly unpopular. Amid economic stagnation and voter anger over immigration, the right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, has surged to 29% in the polls, threatening to supplant the Tories as the main party of the right. The Green Party and Liberal Democrats are also polling strongly, creating a potential five-party system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced he is working to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia and is "rebooting" the country's energy sector amid corruption scandals that have concerned European allies. Russian forces launched new missile and drone strikes on Kharkiv and Kyiv, killing at least nine people. Ukraine has continued to target Russian energy infrastructure in response.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump said he is open to talks with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, even as the U.S. increases its military presence in the Caribbean. The statement came after Maduro was seen singing John Lennon's "Imagine" at a rally protesting U.S. pressure.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Chile, the presidential election is headed to a December runoff between Communist Party member Jeannette Jara and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast. Kast is considered the favorite after right-wing candidates collectively secured 70% of the vote in the first round. Both candidates have focused their campaigns on crime and immigration control.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," highlights the human toll of the Trump administration's cuts to USAID and global assistance. Former USAID official Atul Gawande told The Bulwark that the dismantling of the agency has led to an estimated 600,000 deaths so far, primarily from malnutrition and preventable diseases.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Patients are increasingly turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, according to The New York Times. Many users report that the bots offer a kinder, more attentive alternative to a health care system they find frustrating due to long waits and dismissive doctors. While some physicians see potential benefits, such as more informed patients, they also express concern over the technology's potential for giving incomplete or fabricated answers to high-stakes health questions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The rise of AI is also raising new questions about mortality. In an essay for The Dispatch, Oliver Jia examines how technology is being used to create "digital resurrections" of deceased actors and public figures, such as a holographic Stan Lee. This trend raises ethical issues about consent, exploitation, and the psychological impact of denying grief.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Brie Wolfson of Colossus provides an inside look at the culture of the tech company Cursor, highlighting its focus on calm and "drama-free execution." In her report, she notes that "greatness is created through the collision of little sparks, ignited by people at the peak of the craft who care a lot and won’t stop working until it gets there."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, new data reveals that the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges began before the Trump administration took office. A 7% drop in foreign enrollment last fall was precipitated by waning interest in master's and professional programs, with preliminary figures suggesting the trend will worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system. The administration had sought to impose the fine over alleged discrimination and concerns of antisemitic civil rights violations. The judge's order blocks the government's attempt to secure a $1.2 billion settlement from UCLA and deny grants to its researchers.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias argues that the Democratic senators who ended the recent government shutdown should not be labeled "moderates." He contends they were acting as "earnest progressive Democrats," prioritizing immediate policy outcomes—like preventing financial hardship for federal workers and preserving spending levels—over a prolonged political battle that could have damaged President Trump, albeit at a high cost to the public. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">Folding a winning hand isn’t “moderation” (Slow Boring)</a></p>
