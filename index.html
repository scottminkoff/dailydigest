Members of Congress are visiting the Department of Justice today to view unredacted Epstein files, while Ghislaine Maxwell is scheduled for a virtual deposition before the House Oversight Committee. This push for transparency follows allegations that previous redactions may have unnecessarily obscured names, with Rep. Thomas Massie suggesting the DOJ's process was "not very intelligent." Legal experts note that if the redactions violated the terms of the law passed by Congress, members may have recourse to force further disclosures.

President Trump criticized Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime performance as "un-American," sparking a debate over the political implications of alienationg Latino voters. While the performance focused on unity and Puerto Rican culture, the backlash from the MAGA movement contrasts with the artist's immense popularity and previous criticisms of the administration. Former Trump aide Harrison Fields pushed back against the criticism, noting that his own Puerto Rican grandmother supports the President.

Today marks the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's stay of the Clean Power Plan, a move that legal scholar Steve Vladeck argues launched the modern "shadow docket." This unprecedented intervention allowed the Court to block nationwide regulations without a full hearing or explanation, a practice that accelerated significantly during the Trump administration. Justice Elena Kagan has noted that never before had the Court stayed a regulation that was still under review in the lower courts.

Governor Kathy Hochul has signed the Medical Aid in Dying Act, making New York the 13th state to allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to request life-ending medication. The signing concludes a decade-long legislative battle, with the law set to take effect on August 6. Hochul stated the decision was deeply personal, citing her own mother’s suffering from ALS as a driving factor.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has filed a committee to run for reelection in 2029 while maintaining a complex communication channel with the Trump White House regarding zoning reform. Trump reportedly told Mamdani during a private meeting that he has wanted to overhaul the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) "for years," raising questions about potential benefits to the Trump Organization. Mamdani publicly argues that zoning reform is essential for addressing the city's affordable housing crisis.

Gallant disputed Netanyahu's recent release of security protocols, arguing they were manipulated snippets designed to absolve the Prime Minister of responsibility for the October 7 failures. He specifically noted that Netanyahu was not present at military headquarters during key decision-making hours on the morning of the attack.

Three films sympathetic to the Palestinian narrative have been short-listed for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film, sparking debate over historical accuracy and media bias. Critics argue these films, particularly <i>The Voice of Hind Rajab</i>, present a one-sided view that delegitimizes Israel by flattening complex war events into "myth." Rachel O’Donoghue of HonestReporting warned that these cinematic depictions risk cementing historical distortions that will outlast the current conflict.

During the exchange, Stewart insisted that economics "doesn't take into account what's best for society," dismissing Thaler's explanations of how market incentives can be used for social good.

The verdict rejected Uber's defense that it is merely a technology platform, finding the company failed to implement adequate safety measures such as in-car cameras despite advertising "safe rides." Uber plans to appeal the decision, maintaining that the verdict actually affirms they acted responsibly by investing in rider safety.

Medical experts are advising adult children to initiate proactive health conversations with aging parents before a crisis occurs, emphasizing the need for a clear medical history and understanding of their wishes. Key steps include assessing the safety of the parents' living environment and designating a specific point person for medical decisions to avoid family confusion. Dr. Louise Aronson notes that while these talks are difficult, they prevent the "far, far worse" stress of guessing during an emergency.

The rise of food delivery apps like DoorDash represents a shift in American affluence, where high-cost convenience is increasingly utilized by people across income levels. While some anecdotes highlight imprudent spending by lower-income users, the broader trend reflects record-high median household incomes allowing for new luxuries. Matt Yglesias argues that beyond convenience, the service solves a "discoverability problem" for cuisines that previously lacked delivery infrastructure.

Ross Douthat argues that Donald Trump has effectively ended the traditional "fusionist" conservative movement that united social conservatives and economic libertarians. In its place, a new nationalism is rising, driven by a media ecosystem where individual influencers hold more sway than established institutions. The conversation questions whether liberalism can survive without the counterweight of a coherent, traditional conservatism.

The Trump administration's efforts to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians threatens to devastate the home care industry, which relies heavily on immigrant labor. With immigrants making up 28% of the direct care workforce, experts warn that mass deportations could leave elderly Americans without necessary support and exacerbate existing shortages. One advocate noted that these workers perform essential, intimate tasks that many Americans are unwilling to do, becoming "family" to those they care for.

Ian Tracey argues that the future of software engineering is "K-shaped," where demand for software has no natural ceiling unlike farming or manufacturing. He suggests that as AI lowers the barrier to entry, the work will expand to fill available capacity rather than simply eliminate jobs. This perspective challenges the narrative that AI will replace developers, positing instead that it will enable the creation of more software than ever before.
