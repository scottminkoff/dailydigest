    <div class="content"><h4>Wednesday, December 17, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Politico Playbook:</strong> Vanity Fair published an extensive profile of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, based on 11 on-the-record interviews. Wiles offered candid assessments of administration figures, describing President Trump as having an "alcoholic’s personality" and calling JD Vance a "conspiracy theorist." Following publication, Wiles criticized the piece as "disingenuously framed," though the White House reaction has largely been to rally around her. Meanwhile, House Republicans are moving forward with a health care package that does not extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. (<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/12/17/the-real-susie-wiles-stands-up-00194601">Politico</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Atlantic:</strong> President Trump signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction. While the move does not grant special military authorization, it serves as a rhetorical escalation in the administration's conflict with drug cartels and could impact how domestic drug cases are prosecuted, potentially allowing for life sentences or the death penalty. (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/12/trump-fentanyl-weapon-mass-destruction/680983/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the-atlantic-daily&utm_content=20251216&silverid-ref=MzEwMTkwMTQ4MzMzS0">The Atlantic</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Dispatch:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth briefed Congress regarding ongoing military strikes on suspected drug-trafficking boats. Hegseth refused to publicly release unedited footage of a lethal strike on a boat in the Caribbean but agreed to share it with national security committees. House Democrats are planning to force votes on measures to bar future strikes without congressional approval.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Politico Playbook PM:</strong> Vice President JD Vance visited Pennsylvania to tout the administration's economic record, giving the economy an "A-plus-plus-plus" rating despite new data showing the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent. Additionally, Elon Musk has reportedly begun funding GOP congressional campaigns for the 2026 midterms.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Puck:</strong> The Trump administration has launched a "Genesis Mission" for artificial intelligence development, drawing comparisons to the Manhattan Project. The initiative involves an unprecedented public-private partnership aimed at securing American dominance in AI. (<a href="https://puck.news/inside-the-trump-administrations-ai-genesis-mission/?utm_campaign=The+Best+%26+The+Brightest+-+LEADS+%2812%2F15%2F25%29&utm_content=The+Best+%26+The+Brightest+-+LEADS+%2812%2F15%2F25%29&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io&utm_term=f6c60601d1890182f402">Puck</a>)</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>City & State NY:</strong> Governor Kathy Hochul is expected to announce a deal to sign the Medical Aid in Dying Act, which would allow terminally ill patients with six months or less to live to request medication to end their lives. The Governor is also facing pressure regarding the incoming Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's agenda; a new poll shows broad support for Mamdani's proposal to fund universal child care by taxing the wealthy.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Capitol Confidential:</strong> The state Energy Planning Board approved a 15-year energy plan that includes a shift toward an "all-of-the-above" approach, acknowledging a continued reliance on fossil fuels to ensure reliability. The plan projects that while electrification will eventually lower costs, consumers face significant upfront equipment costs that could spike monthly expenses by 2031.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Politico New York Playbook:</strong> New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will inherit a budget with a projected $380 million deficit for the current year and a potential $6.5 billion gap for the next.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>TPM:</strong> A network of volunteers and advocates in New York City, dubbed the "Undocumented Underground," is mobilizing to protect immigrants from stepped-up ICE enforcement. These efforts include accompanying migrants to hearings at 26 Federal Plaza and establishing legal clinics and safe spaces in churches.

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Dispatch:</strong> Following a shooting attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, that killed 16 people, the Jewish community is grappling with a shattered sense of safety. The gunmen were reportedly motivated by ISIS ideology. Australian officials have promised new gun control measures, but local Jewish leaders feel warnings about rising antisemitism were ignored. (<a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/morning/the-bondi-beach-terror-attack/">The Dispatch</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>City & State NY:</strong> Pope Leo XIV is expected to accept the resignation of Cardinal Timothy Dolan as Archbishop of New York this week. Speculation suggests a bishop from Illinois may be named as his successor.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Politico New York Playbook:</strong> Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani distanced himself from City Comptroller Brad Lander regarding municipal pension fund investments in weapons manufacturers. While both have been critical of Israel's military actions, Lander defended the investments as part of a fiduciary obligation, a stance Mamdani's team criticized.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The New York Times:</strong> Australian authorities have vowed to enact stricter gun laws following the Bondi Beach massacre.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Dispatch:</strong> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with U.S. and European officials to discuss a potential peace deal. The Trump administration has reportedly agreed to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, potentially structured around NATO's Article 5, though negotiations over territory remain complicated. President Trump stated that a deal is "closer now than we have been, ever." (<a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/morning/the-bondi-beach-terror-attack/">The Dispatch</a>)</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The New York Times:</strong> Nick Reiner, the son of director Rob Reiner, has been arrested and charged with murdering his parents, who were found stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>NYT Morning:</strong> China is aggressively investing in humanoid robots, spending over $5 billion this year on startups. While the robots can perform basic tasks, they still struggle with unpredictability and manual dexterity, and the Chinese government has warned of a "robot bubble." (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/business/china-humanoid-robots.html">The New York Times</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Dispatch:</strong> Gold and silver prices have surged, posting their best yearly gains since the late 1970s.

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The New York Times:</strong> Police are continuing their search for a suspect in the shooting death of two students at Brown University.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Chronicle of Higher Education:</strong> There is growing concern among professors and students about classroom surveillance, as recordings of class discussions increasingly end up online.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Voting Rights Lab:</strong> In 2025, states enacted 37 restrictive voting bills, the highest number since 2021. President Trump's allies in state legislatures are reshaping election policies, and new proof-of-citizenship laws in New Hampshire have already resulted in voters being turned away from the polls.

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Bulwark:</strong> Megan McArdle shares a deeply personal essay about discovering a long-lost brother on her mother's deathbed, using the experience to explore the complex moral questions surrounding abortion and existence.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The New York Times:</strong> Ross Douthat argues that the rightward shift of young men is driven by concrete material experiences of discrimination in elite professions and education under DEI initiatives, rather than just online radicalization. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/opinion/ross-douthat-newsletter-young-men-conservatism.html">The New York Times</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Slow Boring:</strong> Matthew Yglesias discusses the challenge of evidence in policy journalism, arguing that while correlation isn't causation, policymakers often have to act on the weight of available evidence rather than waiting for perfect studies, citing early literacy reforms in Mississippi as an example. (<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/confessions-of-a-former-studies-say">Slow Boring</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Argument:</strong> The Argument suggests that while modern children are safer and healthier than in the past, they have lost significant autonomy. The newsletter presents polling data showing a large percentage of voters believe older teenagers shouldn't be left home alone and that allowing 10-year-olds to play alone in a park warrants a CPS investigation. (<a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/how-getting-richer-made-teenagers">The Argument</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Jesse Singal:</strong> Jesse Singal critiques a report by the progressive group "Way to Win," arguing that its "inclusive populism" strategy ignores genuine voter concerns on issues like immigration by attempting to reframe every problem as a class struggle against the wealthy.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Silver Bulletin:</strong> Nate Silver explains his coinage of "Heather Cox Richardsonism" to describe a specific faction of the Democratic base—older, highly educated, and resistant to self-critique—that he compares to a Democratic equivalent of the Tea Party. (<a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/what-is-heather-cox-richardsonism">Silver Bulletin</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Dispatch:</strong> Nick Catoggio criticizes President Trump's "gratuitously vicious" social media post about Rob Reiner's murder, arguing it reveals a total lack of empathy that has been a defining feature of his leadership. (<a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/donald-trump-susie-wiles-rob-reiner-post/">The Dispatch</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>The Bulwark:</strong> Jonathan Cohn argues that Congress still has a window to pass a retroactive extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent a spike in health insurance premiums, noting that similar retroactive measures were successfully implemented in 2021.
