Federal agents have killed at least four people since the start of the year, including a woman in Minneapolis and two individuals in Portland, sparking nationwide protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Trump administration has defended the agents, with Vice President Vance characterizing the Minneapolis victim as a "terrorist," though video evidence has raised questions about the official narrative of self-defense. Critics argue that the removal of oversight guardrails and aggressive rhetoric from the White House have created an environment where agents feel empowered to use lethal force with impunity.

President Trump has called for a temporary, one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10 percent, a move that would require congressional approval to implement. The proposal, which reprises a campaign pledge previously dismissed by analysts as rhetoric, was announced on Friday without specific details on enforcement or compliance. While likely popular with consumers facing high debt, the plan faces significant legislative hurdles and skepticism regarding its economic feasibility.

Mississippi has surged from the bottom of national education rankings to the top 10 in fourth-grade reading proficiency by overhauling its approach to literacy instruction. The state adopted the "science of reading," which emphasizes phonics and vocabulary, while holding schools accountable for student growth rather than just raw proficiency scores. In rural districts like Hazlehurst, reading proficiency has nearly tripled over the last decade, proving that rigorous state-led intervention can yield results even in areas with high poverty rates.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani condemned pro-Hamas chants heard at a protest outside a synagogue in Queens, stating that such language "has no place in New York City." The incident, which also involved racial and homophobic slurs from counter-protesters, drew sharp rebukes from other progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called the behavior "disgusting and antisemitic." This controversy arises as the Mayor faces scrutiny regarding the social media history of recent administration hires.

A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from withholding $10 billion in funding for childcare and social services from New York and four other Democratic-led states. Meanwhile, state-level initiatives continue, with Assemblymember Sarahana Shrestha lauding Governor Hochul's plan to establish universal childcare, a critical need in the Hudson Valley. Additionally, demolition of the controversial "Pike Plan" canopies in Kingston is set to begin after a last-minute legal bid to halt the project was thrown out.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated his intention to phase out U.S. military aid to Israel over the next decade, citing the country's growing economic independence. This position aligns with recent comments from U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who is drafting a proposal to expedite the end of the $3.8 billion annual aid package. Netanyahu told *The Economist* that Israel's economy is projected to reach "about a trillion dollars" within ten years, reducing its reliance on foreign assistance.

The IDF reported killing three Palestinians who crossed the "Yellow Line" into Israeli-controlled territory in Gaza, identifying them as threats or thieves. Satellite imagery indicates that Israel is conducting massive earthworks in northeastern Rafah, potentially to house displaced Gazans as part of a ceasefire implementation. Concurrently, normalization efforts between Israel and Syria are reportedly advancing as Druze and Kurdish factions battle for control in southern Syria.

President Trump met with U.S. oil executives to urge a $100 billion investment in Venezuela's infrastructure following the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro. While the administration frames this as a "Donroe Doctrine" play to secure resources, executives expressed skepticism, with one calling the country currently "uninvestable." Simultaneously, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a fifth oil tanker in the Caribbean as part of the aggressive effort to control Venezuela’s oil assets.

Nationwide protests in Iran have intensified, with reports indicating at least 217 protesters have been killed by security forces. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed the government would "not back down," dismissing threats of U.S. intervention and accusing demonstrators of trying to please President Trump. In response to the crackdown, Iran's attorney general warned that protesters could face the death penalty as "enemies of God."

Trump reportedly told oil executives he plans to act on Greenland "whether they like it or not."

A new study published in *Science* has identified "Gifted Word Learner" dogs that can learn the names of objects passively, much like human toddlers do. Researchers found that these dogs could identify toys by name at a rate significantly higher than chance without explicit training, suggesting they possess socio-cognitive skills previously thought to be unique to humans. The experimental design ensured the dogs had ample playtime to interact with the objects naturally.

Once a symbol of the millennial "power lunch," Sweetgreen has seen its stock price decline significantly as it struggles to maintain its identity as a tech-adjacent startup. In a bid to regain profitability and relevance, the salad chain has introduced fries to the menu, a move executives call "redefining fast food." Critics view the pivot as a sign that the era of venture-capital-subsidized salads is ending.

This week marks the 250th anniversary of the publication of Thomas Paine's "Common Sense," the pamphlet that helped ignite the American Revolution.

Paine's work argued for independence from Great Britain and attacked hereditary monarchy with populist fire, shaping the sentiment of the colonies in 1776.

In his "G-File," Jonah Goldberg argues that President Trump's "Donroe Doctrine"—a personalized twist on the Monroe Doctrine—reveals a foreign policy driven by self-interest and a longstanding obsession with taking other nations' oil. Goldberg contrasts this with the "America First" rhetoric of restraint, suggesting that the MAGA base cares less about isolationism than it does about Trump's projection of dominance and ruthlessness. He warns that this dynamic incentivizes politicians like J.D. Vance to adopt increasingly aggressive postures to win over the base.

Jamelle Bouie contends that while immigration enforcement is necessary, the current iteration of ICE has become a "virtual secret police" characterized by "wanton cruelty" and a hair-trigger use of lethal force. He argues that the recent shooting in Minneapolis is a predictable outcome of an agency culture that recruits based on aggressive, war-like rhetoric and operates with diminished oversight. Bouie concludes that the agency in its current form is incompatible with a free society and reiterates the call to abolish and replace it.
