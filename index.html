<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The political alliance between President Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has fractured, with Trump calling her a “ranting lunatic” on Truth Social and signaling his support for a primary challenge against her. The break followed Greene’s recent calls for the release of the Justice Department’s files on Jeffrey Epstein. In response, Greene posted screenshots of her texts to Trump and criticized his attack.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">House Republican leaders plan to hold a vote on Tuesday on legislation that would force the full release of the Justice Department's records on Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, to lead a new investigation into Epstein after Trump demanded a probe into prominent Democrats.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has transformed the Department of Homeland Security to carry out its mass deportation campaign, a shift that has reportedly diverted resources from efforts to combat child predators and sex trafficking. Border Patrol agents began an immigration crackdown in Charlotte, N.C., over the weekend.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Internal turmoil has erupted at the Heritage Foundation following President Kevin Roberts' defense of Tucker Carlson's recent friendly interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes.

Sen. Lindsey Graham stated, "I’m in the ‘Hitler sucks’ wing of the Republican Party."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In economic news, President Trump issued an executive order rolling back his "reciprocal" tariffs on certain agricultural imports like beef, tomatoes, and coffee, a move that comes amid political pressure over high grocery prices.

In other news, a Federal Reserve governor who stepped down in August was found to have repeatedly violated the central bank’s stock trading rules.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">With the government shutdown over, funding for the SNAP program is flowing again, and the Department of Transportation is easing flight cuts at 40 major airports due to improved air traffic controller staffing. However, it may take weeks for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) to reopen. On Capitol Hill, some moderate House Republicans are pushing to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A Republican effort to redraw Indiana's congressional map to shore up the party's House majority appears to be dead after the GOP leader of the state Senate announced the chamber will not convene in December for that purpose.</p>
