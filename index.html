U.S. Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse and U.S. citizen, during a confrontation with protesters in Minneapolis on Saturday. While the Department of Homeland Security labeled Pretti a "domestic terrorist," video evidence suggests he was disarmed of his legally owned firearm prior to being shot, sparking national outrage and Democratic threats to block funding. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz remarked, "Thank God, thank God we have video," as state officials obtained a restraining order to prevent federal agents from destroying evidence.

A severe winter storm has blanketed a large swath of the U.S. from the South to the Northeast with snow and ice, leaving over one million people without power. The extreme weather has grounded nearly 40 percent of scheduled flights and closed federal offices in Washington, D.C., while putting 85 million people under extreme-cold warnings. FEMA has been activated for disaster response, though officials are reportedly avoiding the word "ice" in messaging to prevent online mockery related to the immigration agency.

<h4><b>3. Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss implementing the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire plan. The talks focus on opening the Rafah crossing, with Israel reportedly requesting the deployment of private American security firms rather than Palestinian Authority forces. Witkoff described the meeting as "constructive and positive," though far-right Israeli ministers continue to criticize the Trump administration's plan.

The IDF has launched a large-scale operation in Gaza City to locate the remains of Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, the last remaining Israeli hostage. This search is a prerequisite for moving to the next phase of the U.S.-backed ceasefire deal, which requires the return of all hostages. Gvili's family has requested that the Rafah crossing remain closed until his body is returned, stating that Hamas continues to deceive the world.

China’s Ministry of National Defense announced an investigation into Gen. Zhang Youxia, the country’s second-highest-ranking military officer, for corruption and discipline violations. The purge is viewed as a "total annihilation of the high command," leaving the Central Military Commission with almost no combat-experienced members. Reports indicate Zhang is accused of leaking nuclear weapon information to U.S. officials and accepting bribes for promotions.

President Trump has de-escalated threats to seize Greenland by force, agreeing to a framework deal with NATO and Denmark. The arrangement would reportedly designate parts of Greenland as American "sovereign base areas" for military operations and mining rights, modeled after British bases in Cyprus. Trump canceled threatened tariffs on European countries following the agreement, calling it "the ultimate long-term deal."

<h4><b>5. Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Legal scholars Woodrow Hartzog and Jessica Silbey argue that the current design of AI systems fundamentally undermines civic institutions necessary for societal coordination. The rapid deployment of these technologies often bypasses the safeguards and purposes that institutions are built to protect. Author Cory Doctorow describes AI as the "asbestos in the walls of our technological society" that will require a generation to excavate.

Higher education leaders are bracing for potential financial instability under a second Trump administration, fearing policy changes that could impact enrollment and funding. The sector has historically been resilient, but concerns are mounting regarding the sustainability of current financial models amidst political hostility. Economist Phillip Levine notes that while the sector has "taken a punch," it has not yet been knocked out.

Federal prosecutors are investigating Frank Carone, former chief of staff to Eric Adams, regarding his health care business ventures and no-fault insurance claims. The probe has expanded to include interviews with associates about financial advances provided to health care providers in exchange for insurance payouts. A psychologist testified he was stopped by FBI agents at an airport and questioned about his dealings with a corporate entity co-founded by Carone.

<h4><b>8. Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis represents a turning point where the federal government appears to be at war with a subset of its own citizenry. The administration's immediate move to label the victim a "domestic terrorist" before evidence was reviewed signals a shift from the rule of law to rule by law. If agents can kill citizens in public without investigation and claim absolute immunity, the constitutional protections for all Americans are effectively nullified.
