    <h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 17, 2025 at 4:34 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant reversal, President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, less than 48 hours before a scheduled vote on the matter. "House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files," Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, "because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax." The statement marks a stark turnaround from the White House's previous efforts to whip GOP members against the bipartisan measure, championed by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). According to POLITICO, the administration had warned that supporting the vote would be seen as a personal move against the president, and Speaker Mike Johnson unsuccessfully tried to dissuade one of the GOP signatories. Trump also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate potential links between Epstein and prominent Democrats.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump also weighed in on the controversy surrounding Tucker Carlson's recent interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Trump expressed support for Carlson, stating, "If he wants to interview Nick Fuentes — I don’t know much about him, but if he wants to do it, get the word out." The interview has caused a rift among conservatives, with figures like Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Shapiro condemning Carlson. The issue has also reverberated at the Heritage Foundation, where President Kevin Roberts' defense of Carlson prompted board member Robert P. George to state he could not remain without a "full retraction."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The White House is focusing on economic affordability amid polling that shows cost-of-living is a top concern for voters. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pushed back on claims that the administration is misleading the public about prices, asserting that purchasing power has increased. The administration recently lifted tariffs on various imported food products to help lower grocery prices. President Trump is scheduled to speak on affordability at an event hosted by McDonald's.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Justice Department's case against former FBI Director James Comey may be in jeopardy after a federal magistrate judge ruled that "government misconduct" by lead prosecutor Lindsey Halligan may have undermined the grand jury process. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick's opinion pointed to a "disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps." Meanwhile, President Trump has continued his calls on social media for investigations into his political opponents, including former FBI Director Chris Wray.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In state politics, President Trump is targeting Indiana Republicans who opposed his preferred congressional redistricting plan. The president plans to endorse a primary challenger against GOP state Sen. Jim Buck and has invited holdout legislators to the White House for meetings. Gov. Mike Braun has sided with Trump on the issue.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case concerning "metering," a policy that allows immigration officials to turn away some asylum seekers at U.S. border crossings. The acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, David Richardson, resigned after a brief tenure. And in a security-related story, MS NOW reports that Kash Patel’s girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, is being protected by an elite FBI SWAT team, a highly unusual security perk.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A key question facing New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is whether President Donald Trump will grant him the top-level security clearance necessary to be briefed on threats to the city. According to POLITICO, Trump has previously used security clearances as a tool for retribution, revoking them from political opponents like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Denying the clearance to the mayor of New York City would be a major escalation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As he prepares to take office, Mamdani is navigating a complex political landscape. He has signaled a moderate stance on policing by stating he will retain NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, but his broader agenda faces significant hurdles. Mamdani and his allies rallied in Union Square to pressure Gov. Kathy Hochul to support his plan to tax the wealthy to fund universal child care. State Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have introduced a bill to raise taxes on millionaires to support the plan. However, Steven Fulop, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, called Mamdani's proposed corporate tax hikes "absolute suicide" for the city's economy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mamdani is also experiencing friction with some political allies. He reportedly will not offer a position in his administration to outgoing city Comptroller Brad Lander, but has promised to back Lander's potential primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman. This has irked the NYC-DSA, which has endorsed City Council Member Alexa Avilés for that seat.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul is preparing for her own political battles as she gears up for a reelection bid next year. She faces the challenge of working with a new socialist mayor in New York City and dealing with a potential federal budget cuts. According to reports, Hochul may be considering some form of non-income tax hike and has a shortlist of potential candidates for lieutenant governor. She has also called on the Trump administration to release federal heat assistance funds, which remain uncertain after the recent government shutdown.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other state and city news, the state has agreed to delay the implementation of its all-electric buildings law pending the outcome of a court case. The state Gaming Facility Location Board is visiting the three remaining sites vying for a downstate casino license. The U.S. Attorney's office in Albany will defend the Justice Department in a lawsuit filed by Maurene Comey, daughter of the former FBI director. And The Legal Aid Society won a ruling requiring an independent official to be appointed to oversee Rikers Island.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-day trip to Israel, which he has billed as a show of solidarity amid rising antisemitism. The visit, likely his last international trip as mayor, includes meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. According to The Forward, Adams has sought to underscore that his successor, Zohran Mamdani, is unlikely to make similar trips.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United Nations Security Council is set to vote today on a U.S.-drafted resolution concerning Gaza that leaves open the possibility of Palestinian statehood. However, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated Israel's opposition to an independent Palestinian state. "Gaza will be demilitarised and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way," Netanyahu stated.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, opting against a traditional official state commission of inquiry. This comes after Israel's High Court of Justice had indicated there was "no real argument" against forming a state commission.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a sign of potentially shifting regional dynamics, Axios reports that the Israeli government is not opposed to Saudi Arabia purchasing U.S. F-35 fighter jets, provided that the move is accompanied by the normalization of relations between the two countries.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">British politics is experiencing a period of significant fracturing, according to The Dispatch. Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval ratings are low, but the Conservative Party has failed to capitalize on this weakness. Amid economic stagnation and voter anger over immigration, support is splintering among five competing parties. The right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, is now polling at 29%, threatening to supplant the Tories as the main party of the right. This fragmentation could lead to a minority government in the next election.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump indicated he "may be having some discussions" with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, even as the U.S. military increases its presence in the Caribbean. The USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, has arrived in the region, part of what The Washington Post calls America's "biggest military presence in the Caribbean in decades."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced efforts to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia and to "reboot" the country's energy sector amid concerns from European allies about corruption. Meanwhile, Russian forces have continued attacks, striking Kharkiv and Kyiv, while Ukraine has targeted Russian oil infrastructure.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Chile's presidential election will go to a runoff in December between Communist Party candidate Jeannette Jara and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast. Kast, who finished second in the initial round, is considered the favorite in the runoff after right-wing candidates collectively secured 70% of the vote.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other world news, a Colombian government airstrike targeting a rebel group killed at least seven children. The Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a peace deal with the M23 rebel group. And the Czech Republic is planning a new $19 billion project to double its nuclear power capacity.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A controversy erupted after Megyn Kelly, on her SiriusXM show, discussed Jeffrey Epstein's sexual preferences. Kelly stated that a source close to the case told her Epstein was "not a pedophile" in the sense of being attracted to very young children, but was into "barely legal" types like 15-year-old girls. The comments drew sharp criticism, with comedian Patton Oswalt joking on the social media platform Bluesky that Kelly should be put in a woodchipper, which led to his suspension. John Oliver also accused Kelly of engaging in "pedophile math." The incident has sparked a broader debate about the precise definitions of terms like pedophilia versus ephebophilia (attraction to adolescents).</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York is poised to become a leader in artificial intelligence regulation with the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Safety and Education (RAISE) Act. The bill, which has passed the legislature, aims to hold major AI companies accountable for potential "critical harm" caused by their models. It is now awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul's signature. The legislation has drawn the attention of the tech industry, and a new pro-AI super PAC, Leading the Future, has announced a multimillion-dollar campaign to oppose the bill's sponsor, Assemblymember Alex Bores, in his bid for Congress.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ken Burns's new documentary series, "The American Revolution," premiered on PBS. Reviewers have noted that its treatment of slavery feels particularly urgent and relevant to current national conversations.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system over allegations of antisemitism and civil rights violations. The Chronicle of Higher Education reports the order thwarts the government's attempt to force a $1.2 billion settlement from UCLA and deny grants to its researchers.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to Jewish Currents, a new "antisemitism prevention" law in California is being criticized as part of a broader campaign against ethnic studies curricula. The analysis argues the law ironically makes it more difficult to engage with the complexities of modern Jewish identity in an academic setting.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data on international student enrollment shows a 7% drop in foreign students at U.S. colleges last fall. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, this decline began before the Trump presidency and was primarily driven by a waning interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures suggest the trend may worsen.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his annual Thanksgiving news release, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett announced he will hand off the writing of the annual shareholder letter to Chairman Greg Abel. Buffett also reflected on aging, writing, "When balance, sight, hearing and memory are all on a persistently downward slope, you know Father Time is in the neighborhood."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly plans to resign as early as 2026, according to the Financial Times. In another corporate leadership change, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced he will retire early next year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal bankruptcy court judge approved OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma's settlement deal, which will require the Sackler family to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years to resolve thousands of lawsuits related to the opioid crisis.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The White House Historical Association has released its limited-edition 2025 ornament celebrating America’s upcoming 250th anniversary. The keepsake features a print of the Declaration of Independence and is trimmed in 24-karat gold.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In unusual news, a woman has pleaded guilty to lying about her astronaut wife accessing their joint bank account from the International Space Station. In a separate story, United Airlines is arguing in response to a passenger's lawsuit that purchasing a "window seat" does not guarantee the seat will actually have a window.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Singal-Minded, Jesse Singal argues that the outrage over Megyn Kelly's recent comments on Jeffrey Epstein is an example of online discourse failing to handle nuance. While Kelly's phrasing about Epstein preferring "barely legal" teenagers over younger children was clumsy, Singal contends that making a technical distinction between ephebophilia (attraction to adolescents) and pedophilia (attraction to prepubescent children) is not an endorsement of Epstein's crimes, but an attempt at precision that gets lost in social media outrage cycles driven by political animosity towards figures like Kelly. <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/is-it-okay-to-call-jeffrey-epstein">https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/is-it-okay-to-call-jeffrey-epstein</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Slow Boring newsletter argues that the Democratic senators who backed down from the government shutdown fight should not be labeled "moderates." Matthew Yglesias contends that true moderation involves aligning with public opinion on substantive issues like energy or immigration. In contrast, the decision to end the shutdown was a tactical choice made by progressives to protect federal workers and secure appropriations levels, thereby sacrificing a powerful political weapon against President Trump for short-term policy goals. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Jewish Currents, Gabi Kirk writes that a new "antisemitism prevention" law in California is less about protecting Jewish students and more a part of a long-running campaign against ethnic studies curricula. Kirk argues the law erodes possibilities for robust public education on both Palestine and the complexities of Jewish identity, ultimately becoming a loss for students. <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss">https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Chronicle of Higher Education features a piece by John W. White, who claims that "secret rules" now govern what can be taught in Florida universities. He describes being told he had to change his course materials to comply with state directives, but when he asked for the specific law or rule backing the demand, none was provided, suggesting a climate of informal censorship and ideological enforcement. <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/secret-rules-now-govern-what-can-be-taught-in-florida">https://www.chronicle.com/article/secret-rules-now-govern-what-can-be-taught-in-florida</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Dispatch, Oliver Jia writes that we are entering an "Era of Immortality" thanks to artificial intelligence. He examines how AI is being used to create holographic appearances of deceased figures like Stan Lee and CGI resurrections of actors for films. Jia warns that while this technology may seem novel, it raises urgent questions about consent, exploitation, and the psychological harm of denying grief and the finality of death. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/ai-death-resurrection-likeness-stan-lee/">https://thedispatch.com/article/ai-death-resurrection-likeness-stan-lee/</a></p>
