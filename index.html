<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
In a stunning overnight operation dubbed "Absolute Resolve," U.S. military forces extracted Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife from Caracas, transporting them to New York to face federal narco-terrorism charges. President Trump subsequently declared that the U.S. would "run" the country for the time being, threatening similar interventions in nations like Colombia and Cuba if they do not align with American interests. Trump described the operation, which resulted in at least 40 Venezuelan casualties but no American deaths, as "one of the most stunning, effective, and powerful displays of American military might."

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Secretary of State Marco Rubio embarked on a media tour to defend the administration's aggressive foreign policy shift, though he stopped short of ruling out a long-term occupation of Venezuela. The operation has reportedly empowered administration hawks, with Rubio emphasizing that while the U.S. is not technically at war, oil sanctions will remain and further strikes are possible if the interim government does not cooperate. Rubio told CBS that while Trump is not publicly ruling out options, there must be "a little realism" regarding the transition process away from the Chavismo system.

Congress returns to Washington today with Democrats planning to force a war powers vote in the Senate regarding the unauthorized military action in Venezuela. Democratic leadership, including Senator Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, criticized the administration for bypassing Congress, while the "Gang of Eight" is set to receive a classified briefing this evening. Jeffries emphasized that "only Congress has the power to declare war," signaling a contentious legislative session ahead as funding deadlines loom.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
New York City's newly inaugurated socialist mayor, Zohran Mamdani, has begun his term by systematically dismantling predecessor Eric Adams's legacy, including deleting all of Adams's tweets and revoking executive orders. Mamdani also reportedly called President Trump directly to voice his opposition to the military strike in Venezuela, calling it "a violation of federal and international law." The new mayor faces immediate challenges, including a potential nurses' strike and fallout from rescinding orders related to antisemitism and the BDS movement.

Governor Kathy Hochul finds herself politically squeezed between the populist agendas of Mayor Mamdani and President Trump as she prepares for her re-election campaign. While facing challengers from both the left and right, Hochul is attempting to address affordability issues by proposing a state-level cap on taxing tips and expanding free child care. Former Governor David Paterson noted the difficulty of her position, advising her to be the "voice of reason" between "two very excitable people."

In Kingston, a political showdown is looming between Mayor Steve Noble and the Common Council over the mayor's veto of a rent control resolution. The council is expected to vote on overriding the veto this Tuesday, the same night the mayor delivers his State of the City address. Separately, the city has filed a lawsuit against the state to remove the Stony Run apartment complex from the Emergency Tenant Protection Act in favor of a workforce regulatory agreement.

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, claimed the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro has "undoubtedly Zionist undertones," prompting the closure of all Jewish institutions in the country. Local Jewish community leaders have instructed members to remain at home amid increased security, preferring to wait and see how the volatile situation plays out before celebrating the regime change. Israel views the Venezuelan Jewish community as highly Zionist and expects Jerusalem's influence to grow following the ousting of Maduro.

Talik Gvili, the mother of Ran Gvili, the last deceased Israeli hostage held in Gaza, stated that President Trump promised her "no towers will be built over Rani in the Strip." The pledge was reportedly made during a tense meeting in Florida where Gvili expressed her family's opposition to proceeding with the second phase of a cease-fire deal before her son is returned. This comes as Israel prepares to reopen the Rafah crossing to allow Palestinians to leave and return under security oversight.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani is facing criticism from Jewish groups for rescinding executive orders that defined antisemitism and prohibited city employees from participating in the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Mamdani, a vocal critic of Israel, has pledged to protect Jewish New Yorkers and retain the Office to Combat Antisemitism despite removing the Adams-era directives. His team reportedly weighed the decision carefully, anticipating backlash while adhering to his campaign stances.

Israeli intelligence officials have warned that Iran may target U.S. bases in the Middle East if domestic protests against the regime threaten its survival. While Prime Minister Netanyahu suggested the protests might be a turning point for Iranians to "take their fate into their own hands," defense officials caution that there is currently no opposition capable of leading a large-scale uprising. Trump has stated that if the regime begins killing protesters, they will be "hit very hard by the United States."

Instagram head Adam Mosseri candidly admitted that the rise of AI-generated content has effectively killed the platform's once-signature "polished aesthetic." In an end-of-year message, Mosseri noted that users largely stopped sharing personal moments to the feed years ago, forcing the platform to evolve. This shift reflects broader changes in how social media is consumed, moving away from personal curation toward AI and algorithmic entertainment.

A professor at the University of California, Davis, is facing disciplinary action after posting a threat about "Zionist journalists" and their children, which she claims was satire. The university concluded the post caused "significant disruption" to operations, sparking a debate over whether reacting to external outrage campaigns violates faculty free-speech rights. Experts warn that punishing faculty based on public backlash may incentivize further online harassment campaigns against academics.

Northwestern University has agreed to a deal, potentially influenced by the incoming Trump administration, that singles out international students for "Open Debate" training.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Jerusalem Demsas argues that while the capture of Maduro is satisfying, the Trump administration's plan to "run" Venezuela ignores the immense complexities of nation-building and repeats past foreign policy mistakes. She contends that despite right-wing rhetoric against central planning domestically, leaders like Trump and Rubio often succumb to the hubris that they can effectively centrally plan foreign nations from afar. The "Donroe Doctrine" implies a dangerous desire to impose will across the hemisphere without accounting for local history or institutions.

Jesse Singal reflects on the fallibility of human reasoning, arguing that when people are "right" about complex issues, it is often due to luck or deference to experts rather than sound independent deduction. Using the example of "heterodox" thinkers who drifted into conspiracy theories, he suggests we should have humility about our beliefs because we ultimately know very little and rely heavily on trust in institutions or groups. He posits that we don't deserve much credit for being right because we cannot escape the trap of deferring to others for knowledge.

In his analysis of the "Donroe Doctrine," David E. Sanger notes that Trump's assertion of U.S. rights to Venezuelan oil and threats to other nations revives the 1823 Monroe Doctrine with a modern, transactional twist. The administration's National Security Strategy explicitly aims to deny competitors like China access to "strategically vital assets" in the Western Hemisphere. This approach prioritizes resource acquisition over democratic restoration, marking a significant shift toward American territorial adventurism.
