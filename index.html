<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Utah Republicans are launching a campaign to repeal a 2018 anti-gerrymandering ballot measure, aiming to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms. This legislative maneuver could result in the state operating under four different district maps within an eight-year span, a frequency one expert described as an "overwhelming burden." The repeal effort is currently backed by national GOP groups but has gathered only 15 percent of the required signatures ahead of a February deadline.

ICE arrests have surged significantly in recent weeks, with reports indicating weekly arrests are up to four times higher than during the Biden administration.
