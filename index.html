    <h4>November 19, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 19, 2025 at 2:04 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a rare display of bipartisanship, the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill requiring the Justice Department to release all unclassified files from its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The House vote was 427-1, with only Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) opposing, and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent. President Trump, who had previously lobbied against the measure, is now expected to sign it into law. According to The Dispatch, Attorney General Pam Bondi will retain the power to withhold information that identifies victims or impairs ongoing federal investigations. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed disappointment that the Senate did not amend the bill, which he believes could do "permanent damage to the justice system." A White House official told Politico that they plan to go on the offensive against any Democrats mentioned in the files, such as Rep. Stacey Plaskett. An effort to censure Plaskett for texting with Epstein during a 2019 hearing failed in the House.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is beginning to dismantle the Department of Education, planning to outsource six of its offices and transfer grant-making programs that support college access to the Department of Labor, according to The Associated Press and The Chronicle of Higher Education. Meanwhile, the administration is also exploring new healthcare policies as enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire. President Trump posted on Truth Social that he wants to send money directly to people to buy their own insurance. This aligns with proposals from other Republicans, like Sens. Rick Scott and Bill Cassidy, which focus on funding individual private accounts instead of subsidies. However, health policy experts cited by The Bulwark note that decades of evidence show "consumer-driven" healthcare often leads people to skip necessary care and fails to control costs.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new poll from The New York Times and KFF found that while about half of the 52 million immigrants in the U.S. feel less safe since President Trump took office, 70 percent would still choose to migrate to the United.S. The poll also revealed that 80 percent of immigrants feel they have achieved or are on their way to achieving the American dream. Concurrently, the Trump administration is intensifying its immigration crackdown. The border czar, Tom Homan, stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will soon ramp up operations in New York City. Separately, 250 federal border agents are being sent to New Orleans for an operation dubbed "Swamp Sweep," with the goal of arresting 5,000 immigrants. In state-level actions, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has designated the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as a "foreign terrorist organization."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal court has blocked Texas's new congressional map, with a judge writing that "substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map." According to The Wall Street Journal, the state plans to appeal the decision. In a separate legal matter, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission, stating that its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp did not constitute illegal monopolization.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">ProPublica reports that the White House intervened in a federal investigation on behalf of Andrew Tate, an online influencer facing rape and human-trafficking charges in Europe.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the state will close the Bare Hill Correctional Facility in the North Country due to a persistent staffing shortage. According to the Times Union, the decision has drawn criticism from both Republican lawmakers and prison reform advocates. Meanwhile, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indefinitely canceled naturalization ceremonies in at least seven upstate counties, leaving hundreds of would-be Americans in limbo. In New York City, a bill passed by the state legislature that would require two-person crews on all subway lines is awaiting Gov. Hochul’s signature. Critics argue the measure would increase costs and hinder automation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the mayoral election, President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has threatened to "flood the zone" with additional ICE agents in New York City. Local elected officials have vowed not to be intimidated. In other electoral news, City & State reports that City Council Member Chi Ossé is preparing to launch an insurgent primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and will seek the endorsement of the NYC-DSA. The field to replace retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler is also growing, with March for Our Lives cofounder Cameron Kasky and LGBTQ+ rights activist Mathew Shurka announcing their candidacies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams continues his international travel, with the New York Post reporting he is looking for a new job while on trips funded by taxpayers. Meanwhile, his administration announced it will add 10,000 after-school seats in the city for fall 2026. During the sentencing of a former Adams aide for involvement in an illegal straw donor scheme, a federal judge remarked on "a notable absence here of the person at the apex of the pyramid."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge dismissed a Department of Justice challenge to a New York law that bans courthouse arrests by immigration authorities. In a separate incident, an NYPD sergeant was arraigned on federal charges for impersonating an ICE agent to harass a woman who had rebuffed his advances. In Buffalo, Mayor Chris Scanlon is reportedly at odds with Comptroller Barbara Miller-Williams over the finalization of the city's capital budget.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A City Council bill that would loosen restrictions on short-term rentals in one- and two-family homes is facing significant opposition. A new report, funded by the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council, argues the measure would harm renters and drive up housing prices. The bill is scheduled for a hearing this week. Additionally, a charter revision commission convened by the City Council will vote today on several proposals, including one that would create a process to remove the mayor for "malfeasance."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As the 2026 gubernatorial race begins to take shape, potential Republican rivals Rep. Elise Stefanik and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman have staked out different positions on abortion. According to New York Playbook, Blakeman is pro-choice, while Stefanik is anti-abortion with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the West Bank, one man was killed and three others were injured in a terror attack at the Gush Etzion Junction after two Palestinians drove their car into a crowd and began stabbing people. According to The Times of Israel, Israeli security forces fatally shot both attackers and found explosives in their vehicle. One of the injured, a woman in her 50s, is in critical condition after apparently being hit by Israeli gunfire.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israel Defense Forces conducted an airstrike on what it described as a Hamas "military compound" within the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. The New York Times reports that Lebanese authorities said 13 people were killed. Hamas denied having any military installations in the camp, claiming the strike hit a group of boys playing on a sports field.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An Israeli human rights group released a report alleging that at least 94 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have died in Israeli custody over the last two years, claiming a pattern of cover-ups and targeted killings. This report is from B'Tselem, whose earlier publication, "Our Genocide," which discussed alleged war crimes by Israel in Gaza, will be the subject of a discussion in New York City moderated by journalist M. Gessen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Palestine Program for Health and Human Rights, part of Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has faced criticism for hosting what a university task force called biased and demonizing webinars about the conflict in Gaza. A recent webinar, titled "Understanding Genocide through a Public Health Lens," was criticized for presenting a one-sided view that condemned Israel without context or debate, according to an essay in The Editors.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly finalizing a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, which was developed in secret talks with Russia and without direct input from Ukraine or European allies. According to Axios and Politico, top U.S. military officials are in Kyiv to present the plan to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A Russian negotiator told Axios the 28-point proposal addresses not only the conflict but also aims to "restore U.S.-Russia ties" and Russia's security concerns. Meanwhile, Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine, with a missile strike killing at least 16 people in the city of Ternopil overnight.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House, where he signed agreements for the U.S. to sell F-35 fighter jets to his country and for cooperation on civil nuclear energy. At a lavish state dinner attended by figures like Elon Musk and Tim Cook, President Trump defended the prince from a reporter's question about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, stating "a lot of people didn't like that gentleman" and that the question was embarrassing to their guest.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has approved CIA plans for covert measures inside Venezuela, even as it has reopened back-channel communications with President Nicolás Maduro’s government. Separately, a U.S. military campaign is targeting suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, though its ultimate goal regarding the Maduro regime remains unclear. According to The Dispatch, some experts warn this military approach is historically ineffective and could empower criminal organizations if it leads to regime change.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other global news, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainians accused of working for Russia are suspected of being behind a railway line explosion in Poland. In Nigeria, a joint investigation by The New York Times and The Examination found that lead dust from factories recycling old car batteries—often for American vehicles—is causing harmful levels of lead poisoning in the local population. Belgian police arrested eight people in connection with a plot to assassinate the chief prosecutor of Brussels, and Chinese agents are reportedly using LinkedIn to target British MPs.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the tech world, Google has released its latest AI model, Gemini 3, which it says shows marked improvements in reasoning and coding. Microsoft, Nvidia, and AI company Anthropic have partnered on a new AI infrastructure deal, with Nvidia and Microsoft investing $5 billion and $10 billion respectively in Anthropic. In a setback for some internet users, cybersecurity firm Cloudflare suffered a major outage that took down popular websites including X and ChatGPT.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the art market, Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer" sold for $236.4 million at a Sotheby's auction, making it the most expensive modern artwork ever sold at auction. Meanwhile, the Sagrada Família in Barcelona has officially become the world's tallest church after workers placed the first part of a cross atop its central tower. In film news, a live-action "Legend of Zelda" movie is reportedly in the works, and director Noah Baumbach has a new film, "Jay Kelly," starring George Clooney and Adam Sandler, which will begin streaming on Netflix in December.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A wrongful conviction case highlights flaws in the justice system. George Bell, who spent 24 years in prison for a double homicide he did not commit, was exonerated and awarded a $17.5 million settlement from the City of New York. The district attorney had originally sought the death penalty in his case.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A recent newsletter from Taylor Lorenz sparked a broader discussion about what one writer calls the "culture of casual calumny" in journalism. Jesse Singal's Substack argues that Lorenz's piece, which labeled AI critics Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares "anti-AI grifters," exemplifies a style of punditry focused on inflicting reputational damage rather than engaging in thoughtful analysis.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is advancing its plan to dismantle the Department of Education by transferring some of its responsibilities to other agencies. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, grant-making programs that support college access and student success are being outsourced to the Department of Labor.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Newly revealed emails show disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's deep ties to prominent researchers. The emails show academics asking Epstein for funding, expressing gratitude, and seeking his advice on how to handle sexual-misconduct allegations. His support extended to programs at institutions like Harvard University.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A program at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the Palestine Program for Health and Human Rights, has drawn criticism for hosting one-sided webinars on the conflict in Gaza. A report from a presidential task force at Harvard found the events were characterized by "bias and misinformation" and that students experienced them as a form of "demonization" of Israel and Israelis.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In New York, the SUNY system is bucking a national trend of declining college enrollment. According to the Times Union, the state university system has seen a 3% increase in enrollment.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to Scientific American, city-dwelling raccoons are showing early signs of domestication, with some evolving shorter snouts, a feature common in domesticated animals. In an update on last year's Baltimore bridge collapse, investigators found that the six construction workers who died might have survived if police had alerted them about the incoming ship. The crash was reportedly caused by a small, misplaced sticker on a wire. In a story of retail dedication from The New York Times, a customer bought all 4,500 remaining items from a beloved clothing store after it announced its closure. Finally, the MacArthur Foundation has awarded $100 million to Sentinel, a private pandemic prevention network operating across Africa.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan V. Last suggests that while 2025 has been a year of "maximum peril" under a Trump presidency, recent events indicate the former president may be "past his high-water mark." Last outlines potential scenarios for Trump's power to decline, particularly after the 2026 midterms, but also warns of the extralegal means he could still employ. He concludes that liberal democracy cannot survive if it must depend on one political party continuously winning elections. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/spoiler-we-win-trump-2026-midterms-2028">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/spoiler-we-win-trump-2026-midterms-2028</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jesse Singal, writing on his Substack, critiques what he terms the "culture of casual calumny" in modern journalism. Using a Taylor Lorenz newsletter that attacks AI researchers as a case study, Singal argues that this aggressive, attack-dog style of punditry inflicts reputational damage without careful consideration and ultimately undermines the practice of inquisitive journalism. <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/i-hate-journalisms-culture-of-casual">https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/i-hate-journalisms-culture-of-casual</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias argues that while there is a new political consensus to focus on "affordability," doing so requires making difficult choices that conflict with the interests of key political constituencies. He contends that both Democrats, who must contend with unions and environmental groups, and Republicans, with their anti-immigration and protectionist policies, often wear an "affordability skinsuit" while advancing agendas that can increase costs for consumers. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices">https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Dispatch, Mary Speck argues that the U.S. military campaign against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean has an unclear strategy. Citing five decades of the "war on drugs," she contends that military force is often an ineffective tool and warns that a potential regime change in Venezuela could lead to prolonged chaos, ultimately empowering criminal groups. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/venezuela-drugs-war-cartels-ineffective/">https://thedispatch.com/article/venezuela-drugs-war-cartels-ineffective/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times's Jennifer Weiner writes that in the rush to find damning information about Donald Trump, Democrats have weaponized the victims in the Jeffrey Epstein story. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/trump-epstein-files.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/trump-epstein-files.html</a></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Editors, Robert L. Friedman criticizes a webinar hosted by Harvard's Palestine Program for Health and Human Rights, arguing it was a one-sided, anti-Israel event that abandoned its public health mission for political activism. He notes that the event repeatedly labeled Israel's actions as "genocide" without providing context, debate, or meaningful public health analysis. <a href="https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization">https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn analyzes new Republican healthcare proposals designed to replace expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. He argues that the plans, which center on giving money directly to individuals to "shop" for their own care, ignore decades of evidence indicating that such "consumer-driven" models do not create a more efficient system and often cause people, particularly those with low incomes, to forgo necessary medical treatment. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out</a></p>
