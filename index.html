    <div class="content"><h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Donald Trump has reversed his position on the Jeffrey Epstein files, urging House Republicans in a Truth Social post to vote in favor of their release ahead of a vote scheduled for Tuesday. The shift comes after the administration and GOP leadership fought to block the vote, which was forced by a bipartisan discharge petition. Trump has also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate potential links between Epstein and several prominent Democrats. The directive follows the House Oversight Committee's release of 23,000 documents from the Epstein estate, in which, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, Trump is mentioned more frequently than any other prominent figure. The issue has caused a public rift between Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been a vocal proponent of releasing the files. Greene stated in a CNN interview that Trump's subsequent attacks on her have been "hurtful" and "dangerous."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Amid fallout from the Epstein issue, the Trump administration is attempting to pivot to a focus on affordability. The president signed an executive order lifting tariffs on a range of imported food products, including coffee, beef, and fruit, in an effort to lower grocery prices. Other ideas being discussed include $2,000 rebate checks from tariffs and the launch of 50-year mortgages. The affordability push comes as the Federal Aviation Administration lifted all restrictions on commercial flights that had been imposed on 40 major airports during the recent government shutdown.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times investigation found that the Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, a move that has reportedly undermined other law enforcement operations, including investigations into child exploitation, sex trafficking, and terrorism financing. This shift in resources is evident as U.S. Border Patrol agents began a new immigration crackdown in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the weekend, with plans to target New Orleans next. Meanwhile, hundreds of federalized National Guard troops who had been sent to Portland and Chicago are returning home after court challenges prevented their deployment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, Pete Skandalakis, a longtime Georgia prosecutor, will take over the state’s election interference case against Trump, replacing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Separately, a federal bankruptcy judge approved a settlement for OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma that will require the Sackler family to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will require a top-level security clearance from the federal government, raising the question of whether President Trump, who has previously revoked clearances from political rivals like Attorney General Letitia James, will grant it. In his first weeks post-election, Mamdani is also navigating political tensions with allies; he has reportedly promised to back city Comptroller Brad Lander’s potential primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman, a move that conflicts with the NYC-DSA's recent endorsement of City Council Member Alexa Avilés for the same race. Mamdani has also indicated confidence in keeping Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner but has yet to make it official.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As Mamdani prepares to take office, his progressive agenda is already facing pushback. Steven Fulop, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, called the mayor-elect's proposal to raise corporate taxes "absolute suicide." However, hundreds gathered in Union Square for a DSA-organized rally to demand that Governor Kathy Hochul support Mamdani's plans to tax the wealthy to fund initiatives like free public child care. In Albany, a bill matching Mamdani's plan to raise taxes by 2% on households with incomes over $1 million was introduced by State Sen. John Liu and Assemblymember Phara Souffrant Forrest.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Meanwhile, the race for the next City Council speaker is intensifying. Candidates are participating in a series of public forums, and according to City & State, Brooklyn's Democratic delegation, the largest in the council, is attempting to unite as a voting bloc to increase its influence. In other city news, a judge has temporarily halted a new agreement over the use of Citi Field's parking lot, a move that could jeopardize the Mets owners' bid to build a casino on the site. The state's Gaming Facility Location Board is currently touring the three remaining potential casino sites in the Bronx and Queens.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Hochul is gearing up for her reelection bid and has called on the Trump administration to release federal heat assistance funding. In state legal matters, the U.S. Attorney's office in Albany will handle the defense in a lawsuit filed by Maurene Comey. The New York political community is also mourning the recent death of Sid Davidoff, a veteran lobbyist and government relations professional with roots in the John Lindsay administration.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, opting against a traditional state commission of inquiry as had been urged by the High Court of Justice. The cabinet has not yet agreed on the commission's scope or organization. Meanwhile, on the international stage, the U.N. Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution concerning Gaza that leaves open the possibility of Palestinian statehood. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Israel’s opposition to an independent Palestinian state. In a related diplomatic development, Axios reported that Israel is not opposed to Saudi Arabia purchasing U.S. F-35 fighter jets, provided the deal is linked to the normalization of relations between the two countries.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City's outgoing Mayor, Eric Adams, is on a multi-day trip to Israel, described as a farewell visit and a show of solidarity amid rising antisemitism. During his trip, he is meeting with top officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government is in turmoil as his approval rating has plummeted to -48 percent. According to The Dispatch, economic stagnation and widespread anger over immigration have led to a fracturing of the British political landscape, with both the Labour and Conservative parties polling below 20 percent. The right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, now leads the polls with 29 percent support, threatening to supplant the Tories as the main party of the right. The far-left Greens and center-left Liberal Democrats are also gaining traction.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced efforts to reboot the country's energy sector amid corruption concerns and is working to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia. The moves come as Russian missile and drone strikes killed at least nine people in Kharkiv and Kyiv, while Ukraine continues to target Russian energy infrastructure. In Paris, Zelensky is seeking to purchase anti-missile systems.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump said he "may be having some discussions" with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, just as the U.S. military increases its presence in the Caribbean with the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. A recent U.S. airstrike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel in the Caribbean killed all four people aboard. In a separate development, Venezuelan dictator Maduro was seen singing John Lennon's "Imagine" during an event discussing U.S. tensions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Chile’s presidential election is headed for a December runoff between Communist Party member Jeannette Jara, who received a plurality of votes, and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast, who is seen as the favorite. In other international news, the Trump administration's cuts to USAID have led to an estimated 600,000 deaths, including 400,000 children, according to a report highlighted by The Bulwark and former USAID official Atul Gawande. A new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," details the human toll of the aid cuts on a refugee family in Kenya.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Patients are increasingly using A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, according to The New York Times. Many users report the bots offer a kinder, more attentive alternative to a traditional healthcare system they feel is rushed and unaffordable. While some doctors see benefits in patients arriving at appointments better informed, they also express concern over the bots' potential to provide inaccurate information for high-stakes health decisions. An Oxford study found that participants using chatbots for medical scenarios chose the appropriate course of action less than half the time.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In technology leadership, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly plans to resign as early as 2026. In New York, the tech industry is closely watching the "RAISE Act," a bill awaiting Governor Hochul's signature that would hold major AI firms accountable for "critical harm." In response, a new pro-AI super PAC, "Leading the Future," announced a multimillion-dollar campaign to oppose the congressional bid of the bill's sponsor, Assemblymember Alex Bores.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In San Francisco, the driverless taxi industry faced a setback after a vehicle killed a beloved cat, intensifying the debate over the technology's safety and regulation.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to new data reported by The Chronicle of Higher Education, the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges began before the Trump administration. A 7% drop in foreign enrollment last fall was driven by decreased interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures for this year suggest the trend may worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system over alleged discrimination and concerns of antisemitic civil rights violations. The judge ruled the government cannot impose "coercive" funding threats against the university.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who has led the company since 2014, announced plans to retire early next year. In his Thanksgiving news release, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett reflected on legacy and aging, announcing that Chairman Greg Abel will now write the annual shareholder letter. In a story from CNBC, a woman pleaded guilty to lying about her astronaut wife accessing a shared bank account from the International Space Station. And according to People, United Airlines is arguing in a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that purchasing a "window seat" does not guarantee the presence of a window.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In *Slow Boring*, Matthew Yglesias argues that the Democratic senators who backed down from the government shutdown fight were not acting as "moderates," but rather as earnest progressives prioritizing immediate policy outcomes—such as protecting federal workers and SNAP recipients—over a political battle that might have damaged President Trump. He defines moderation as aligning with public opinion on key issues, not folding on a confrontation. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for *The Chronicle of Higher Education*, John W.
