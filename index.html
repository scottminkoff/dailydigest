    <div class="content"><h4>November 20, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law, which directs the Justice Department to release all unclassified documents related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days. The bill passed both the House and Senate with near-unanimous support after an intense public pressure campaign. Trump had previously lobbied against the bill but reversed his position over the weekend when it became clear he would lose the vote. However, the bill contains loopholes, and Attorney General Pam Bondi will retain the power to withhold information that identifies victims or impairs ongoing investigations. The case has also created intra-party friction; House Oversight Chair James Comer accused House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of soliciting campaign funds from Epstein in 2013, based on an email from a consultant. Jeffries called Comer a "stone-cold liar."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey is facing significant challenges due to what one federal magistrate judge called "staggering procedural irregularities." During a court hearing, prosecutors admitted that the full grand jury never reviewed the final, two-count indictment against Comey after it had rejected a third count. The judge's grilling of the prosecution team, led by Trump-appointed interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, was described by reporters as "excruciatingly awkward." Previous filings have raised concerns about mishandled attorney-client communications, the improper use of a search warrant, and misleading statements made to the grand jury.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A proposed 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, drafted by the Trump administration in consultation with Russia, is facing a growing backlash. According to Axios and other outlets, the plan would require Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls, including the rest of the Donbas region, and significantly limit the size of its military in exchange for security guarantees. Ukrainian and European officials felt "blindsided" by the proposal, which they see as a deep concession to Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who may be facing a no-confidence vote at home over a corruption scandal, is reportedly not interested in discussing the plan. In a sign of potential discord within the administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio used language that appeared aimed at mollifying Ukraine, even as the White House remains "bullish" on the deal. Meanwhile, Ukraine confirmed it has used U.S.-provided long-range ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House for a lavish state dinner. During a press availability, Trump defended the crown prince and lashed out at a reporter for asking about the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence concluded was ordered by bin Salman. "Things happen," Trump said, dismissing the killing. The visit coincided with the signing of an agreement for the U.S. to sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and a declaration of cooperation on civil nuclear energy. Trump also signaled an intent to focus on the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, a priority for the Crown Prince.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is moving to dismantle the Department of Education by outsourcing six of its offices, including grant-making programs for college access, to other agencies like the Department of Labor. It is also restructuring foreign aid programs following the shuttering of USAID; most of the agency's projects were cut, with remaining functions transferred to the State Department. A study in The Lancet estimated the cancellation of USAID programs could result in around 14 million preventable deaths by 2030 from issues like malaria, cholera, and malnutrition.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new NPR/PBS/Marist poll shows Democrats with a 14-point advantage on a generic congressional ballot, their largest since 2017. The poll also found President Trump's approval rating has dropped to 39%, his lowest since the aftermath of the January 6th attack. Another poll from Marquette Law School found similar Democratic advantages. Many voters still view the economy negatively, and a Fox News poll found that twice as many voters hold Trump responsible for the current economy than former President Biden. The delayed September jobs report, set for release today, is expected to show weak employment growth.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, Dick Cheney's funeral is being held today in Washington; President Trump and Vice President JD Vance are not expected to attend. The Justice Department has charged Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL) with stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds to finance her 2021 campaign. A federal court has blocked Texas's new congressional map, ruling it was a racial gerrymander, though the state plans to appeal. And following Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York, Trump's border czar Tom Homan said he would "flood the zone" with ICE agents in the city.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced that he will keep Jessica Tisch on as NYPD Commissioner when he takes office, forging an unlikely partnership. As reported by The New York Times, Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has supported defunding the police, will work with Tisch, a conservative on policing who wants to hire 5,000 new officers. The decision was widely praised across the political spectrum as a move toward stability. The two are scheduled for a high-stakes meeting with President Trump at the White House on Friday, where Mamdani says he will "speak plainly" about the struggles of New Yorkers.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mamdani has also waded into a contentious debate within the Democratic Socialists of America, urging the group not to endorse City Council Member Chi Ossé's primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Mamdani, whose mayoral campaign was significantly boosted by the DSA, attended a closed-door forum to argue that the party should focus on delivering for New Yorkers rather than engaging in a difficult primary fight.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A political battle over reproductive rights is brewing ahead of the 2026 gubernatorial race. Rep. Elise Stefanik, a declared Republican candidate, stated she "misspoke" in a 2024 radio interview in which she said she opposed access to in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Her reversal came as she co-sponsored a bill to provide tax credits for IVF. The issue highlights a divide in the potential GOP primary, as another possible candidate, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, is pro-choice. Gov. Kathy Hochul's campaign has already begun sparring with Stefanik over the issue.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The state plans to close the Bare Hill Correctional Facility in the North Country due to a persistent staffing shortage. Officials say no layoffs are expected. The decision drew criticism from both Republican lawmakers, who called it dangerous, and from prison reform advocates, who argued it doesn't address underlying issues of staff brutality and inmate deaths.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, New York's medical cannabis industry is suing state regulators, demanding they crack down on the influx of illicit marijuana sales. A bill to require more transparency from the New York Power Authority regarding its public renewable energy projects has passed the legislature and awaits Gov. Hochul's signature. And the race to succeed retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler is growing, with attorney George Conway exploring a run, joining recent entrants Cameron Kasky, a March for Our Lives co-founder, and LGBTQ+ rights activist Mathew Shurka.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">During a six-week-old ceasefire, the Israel Defense Forces launched a series of airstrikes across Gaza, killing at least 25 people according to the local health ministry. The IDF stated the strikes were a response to Hamas militants firing on its troops in southern Gaza, an attack that caused no Israeli casualties. In a separate incident, an Israeli airstrike hit the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, which the IDF claimed was a Hamas military compound. Lebanese authorities reported 13 people were killed. Hamas denied having military installations in Lebanon's refugee camps.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As two years of Israeli bombardment have left Gaza's formal banking infrastructure in ruins, Palestinians are increasingly relying on cryptocurrency for survival. A report in Jewish Currents details how stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, like USDT, are now widely used to buy groceries, conduct international trade for essential goods, and receive aid from abroad. While crypto has provided a crucial lifeline, it also presents significant risks, including fraud from informal brokers and the exclusion of residents who lack the technical knowledge or smartphones to participate in the digital economy.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones on western Ukraine, killing at least 25 people in the city of Ternopil and injuring dozens more. Separately, Britain's defense secretary stated that a Russian spy ship had entered British waters for the second time this year and pointed lasers at Royal Air Force pilots. In Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainians accused of working for Russia were suspected of being behind a weekend railway line explosion.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An Argentinian congressional investigation has accused President Javier Milei of potential "alleged fraud" in connection with his social media promotion of a little-known cryptocurrency. China has suspended seafood imports from Japan in retaliation for comments by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi implying Japan would defend Taiwan from an invasion. Mount Semeru, one of Indonesia’s most active volcanoes, erupted, spewing hot ash and debris that blanketed nearby villages. And a report in The New York Times notes that while the number of sexual assaults reported on cruises is rising, victims of crimes on foreign ships in international waters face significant hurdles in seeking justice.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nvidia, the company whose chips have powered the artificial intelligence boom, reported another quarter of soaring profits, with revenue of $57 billion, up 62% from a year ago. CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of an AI bubble. The tech boom continues to drive valuations, with TikTok's parent company ByteDance reaching a $480 billion valuation. Other major tech deals include Adobe acquiring digital marketing platform Semrush for $1.9 billion, and Target announcing a partnership with OpenAI to integrate shopping into ChatGPT. In the wake of newly released documents showing his correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers announced he is stepping down from the board of OpenAI.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times report highlights a surge in attendance at Orthodox Christian parishes, particularly among conservative young men who have been dubbed "Orthobros." The converts say they are drawn to the faith's demanding nature and strict requirements, which they feel gives them a sense of purpose. Many were introduced to Orthodoxy by online influencers who promote traditional ideas of masculinity.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In entertainment, "Wicked: For Good," the second part of the movie adaptation of the Broadway musical, opens this week. The Grand Ole Opry is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. And a Harper's Bazaar profile on the family of NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani notes that his mother is the acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is continuing its efforts to dismantle the Department of Education, with plans to outsource several grant-making programs that support college access and student success to the Department of Labor. In New York, however, the State University of New York (SUNY) system is bucking national trends, reporting a 3% increase in enrollment for the third consecutive year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Newly released documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation have shed light on his deep connections to the academic world. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, emails from Epstein’s inbox reveal extensive ties to prominent researchers, who asked him for funding, expressed gratitude, and in one case, sought his advice on how to handle sexual-misconduct allegations. Following revelations that he corresponded with Epstein, former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers announced he will step down from the board of OpenAI.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">At the University of Arkansas, faculty are concerned after the state legislature’s Joint Budget Committee requested course syllabi, materials, and scholarship information from the university's Middle East studies program. Faculty members told The Chronicle they do not know the reason for the request.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A portrait by the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt sold for over $236 million at a Sotheby's auction, making it the second most expensive painting ever sold at auction. In crime news, a January 6 rioter who was pardoned by President Trump has been arrested for child sexual abuse. Separately, a fugitive Canadian former Olympic snowboarder has been indicted on murder and drug charges related to a billion-dollar cocaine network. In Japan, residents are fighting back against a recent spate of bear attacks. An airline pilot from New Jersey died last year after developing a severe meat allergy from a tick bite. And according to Scientific American, city-dwelling raccoons are showing early signs of domestication, such as evolving shorter snouts.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his New York Times newsletter, David French argues that the Trump administration's prosecution of James Comey is a case study in "legal incompetence," detailing numerous procedural failures by the prosecution that could prove fatal to the case. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/opinion/comey-case-trump.html">Link to article from The New York Times</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark's Jonathan Cohn writes that the latest Republican health care ideas, which focus on giving people money to "shop" for their own coverage, are based on a flawed, decades-old concept. He contends that evidence shows people do not shop for health care effectively and that high-deductible plans often lead patients to skip necessary care. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out">Link to article from The Bulwark</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias suggests that while "affordability" has become a new political buzzword, politicians on both sides are unwilling to make the hard choices necessary to achieve it, often because it would mean confronting friendly interest groups like unions or environmental activists. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices">Link to article from Slow Boring</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Katherine J. Wu, in The Atlantic, critiques what she calls HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "just be healthy" theory of immunity, arguing that it reflects a dangerous dismissal of germ theory in favor of an oversimplified belief that good nutrition and exercise are sufficient to weather pandemics. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/11/rfk-jr-germ-theory-immunity/684988/">Link to article from The Atlantic</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch's Nick Catoggio contends that the Trump administration has deliberately created a "crisis of authority" where the law is opaque, particularly concerning potential military action against Venezuela. He argues this is designed to ensure soldiers follow the president's will over the law, leaving them unable to determine what constitutes a legal order. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/democrats-venezuela-illegal-military-orders/">Link to article from The Dispatch</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Also in The Dispatch, Jonah Goldberg argues that the modern GOP is undergoing a "Nixonification," adopting the playbook of a president who was ultimately a liberal pragmatist animated by resentment and a desire for power rather than conservative ideology. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/nixons-revenge/">Link to article from The Dispatch</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Bulwark, Jonathan V. Last makes the case that we may have passed the "high-water mark" of Donald Trump's power, citing a series of recent setbacks and growing resistance within the GOP. However, he also outlines how Trump could still attempt to consolidate power through extralegal means. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/spoiler-we-win-trump-2026-midterms-2028">Link to article from The Bulwark</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo offers a counterpoint, arguing that Trump's waning power will likely make him more, not less, reckless and dangerous, with January 6 serving as the primary example of how he behaves when cornered. <a href="http://r.mail.talkingpointsmemo.com/mk/cl/f/sh/1t6Af4OiGsDg0cCB4ih5c8uZp4FXtr/6iZLAa9HUzG3edblog/trump-has-the-look-of-the-weak-horse-people-are-acting-accordingly">Link to article from Talking Points Memo</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Nicole Gelinas argues that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani may have set a political trap for himself by giving Gov. Kathy Hochul an opening to resist his more progressive plans, which could harm the state's economy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/opinion/hochul-mamdani-new-york-democrats.html">Link to article from The New York Times</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Robert L. Friedman, for The Editors, critiques a Harvard public health program's webinar on Gaza, calling it one-sided, anti-Israel propaganda that ignored the context of the conflict and presented a "demonizing view of Israel" under the guise of academic analysis. <a href="https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization">Link to article from The Editors</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing on Substack, Jesse Singal criticizes what he calls journalism's "culture of casual calumny," using a recent newsletter that labeled AI researchers as "grifters" as an example of a style that privileges accusation and ideological posturing over level-headed analysis. <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/i-hate-journalisms-culture-of-casual">Link to article from Singal-Minded</a></p>
