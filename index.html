    <h4>November 19, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 19, 2025 at 2:24 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill to compel the Justice Department to publicly release its unclassified files on the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The House approved the measure 427-1, and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent shortly after. President Trump, who had previously lobbied against the bill and expressed concerns about its impact on the justice system, is expected to sign it into law. The act directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to make the documents available within 30 days, though she can withhold information that identifies victims or impairs federal investigations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is moving to dismantle the Department of Education by outsourcing at least six of its offices to other federal agencies. Grant-making programs that support college access and student success will be transferred to the Department of Labor. In other administrative news, former FBI Director James Comey is in court as his lawyers seek to have malicious prosecution charges against him dismissed, arguing they are a result of President Trump's political retribution.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new poll from The New York Times and KFF reveals that while about half of all immigrants in the U.S. feel less safe since President Trump took office, roughly 70 percent say they would still choose to migrate to the United States. The survey found that immigrants across all legal statuses are worried about deportation for themselves or family members, with about a third of noncitizens avoiding activities like travel or going to work. Still, 80 percent of respondents said they were either on their way to achieving the American dream or had already achieved it. This comes as the administration's border czar, Tom Homan, announced plans to increase U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in cities like New York.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire, Republican leaders are floating various health care policy ideas. According to The Bulwark, proposals from President Trump, Sen. Rick Scott, and Sen. Bill Cassidy center on giving money directly to individuals to purchase their own insurance or cover medical costs. The concept aims to empower "consumer-driven health care," but critics point to evidence suggesting that people are not effective at "shopping" for medical care and that higher out-of-pocket costs can lead them to skip necessary treatments.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In legal and political developments, a federal court blocked Texas' new congressional map, with the majority opinion stating there is "substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map." Governor Greg Abbott said the state will appeal the decision. Abbott also officially designated the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) a "foreign terrorist organization." Separately, a ProPublica report alleges that the White House intervened in a federal investigation on behalf of Andrew Tate, an online influencer facing rape and human-trafficking charges in Europe.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Council Member Chi Ossé is seeking the endorsement of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America for his insurgent primary campaign against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to City & State, Ossé, who recently joined the DSA, will make his case to the organization's members this week. The potential challenge has reportedly intensified debate within the socialist group.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The state will close the Bare Hill Correctional Facility in the North Country due to persistent staffing shortages. The Times Union reports that the closure, the 13th state prison to be shut down in the last decade, has drawn criticism from both Republican lawmakers, who call it "dangerous," and criminal justice advocates, who argue it fails to address deeper issues of safety and brutality within the prison system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As Mayor Eric Adams concludes his term, he continues a series of international trips, most recently to Uzbekistan. The New York Post reports he is on a taxpayer-funded tour while also admitting to searching for a new job. Meanwhile, a federal judge sentencing a former Adams campaign aide for a straw donor scheme commented on "the notable absence here of the person at the apex of the pyramid."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">With Rep. Jerry Nadler's retirement, the Democratic primary field for his Manhattan congressional seat is growing. According to New York Playbook, March for Our Lives co-founder Cameron Kasky and LGBTQ+ rights activist Mathew Shurka have both entered the race, joining a field that already includes multiple state and city officials.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indefinitely canceled naturalization ceremonies in at least seven upstate counties, leaving hundreds of aspiring citizens in limbo. In other immigration-related news, a federal judge has dismissed a Department of Justice challenge to a New York law that bans immigration agents from making arrests inside courthouses.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In policy debates, a City Council bill that would loosen restrictions on short-term rentals in one- and two-family homes is facing opposition. A new report, funded by the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council, argues the measure would drive up rents and home prices. Supporters of the bill, including the Airbnb-backed group Restore Autonomy & Rights, say it provides a crucial source of income for homeowners.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A man was killed and three others were injured in a terror attack at the Gush Etzion Junction in the West Bank. Two Palestinian assailants drove their car into a crowd before getting out and stabbing people. Israeli security forces fatally shot both attackers and found explosives in their vehicle. One of the injured, a woman, is in critical condition after reportedly being hit by Israeli gunfire.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israel Defense Forces conducted an airstrike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, which it claimed was targeting a Hamas training compound. Lebanese authorities reported that 13 people were killed. Hamas denied having any military installations in Lebanon's Palestinian camps and asserted the strike hit a group of boys playing on a sports field.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An Israeli human rights organization released a report alleging that at least 94 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have died in Israeli custody over the last two years. The group claimed a pattern of targeted killings and cover-ups by authorities.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's shuttering of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and restructuring of its remaining functions under the State Department are having widespread global effects. According to The Dispatch, the shift has terminated 83 percent of USAID's projects, ranging from AIDS prevention and women's health clinics to agricultural resilience programs. A June study in The Lancet estimated these cancellations could result in 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. The administration's focus has moved from long-term development to narrow, short-term crisis response, a change that humanitarian workers warn will only worsen future disasters.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump welcomed Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House for a lavish state dinner attended by figures including Elon Musk and Tim Cook. Trump dismissed a reporter’s question about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence concluded was ordered by the prince. During the visit, the two countries signed an agreement for the U.S. to sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and to move toward cooperation on civil nuclear energy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The White House has reportedly drafted a secret peace plan to end the war in Ukraine after direct talks with Moscow, with a framework potentially being agreed upon this week. According to Axios and Politico, the plan was formulated without direct input from Ukraine or European allies and will be presented to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A Russian envoy told Axios he was optimistic because "the Russian position is really being heard." The news comes as Russia launched another major missile and drone assault on western Ukraine, killing at least 16 people in the city of Ternopil.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Gaza, where the formal banking infrastructure has been destroyed, Palestinians are increasingly turning to cryptocurrency for survival, according to a report in Jewish Currents. Digital currencies like USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, are being used for everything from buying groceries to receiving international aid and conducting business transactions. While providing a critical lifeline, this informal system also carries significant risks of fraud and exclusion for those without technical knowledge or reliable internet access.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has approved CIA plans for covert measures inside Venezuela while simultaneously reopening back-channel communications with President Nicolás Maduro's government. Meanwhile, voters in Ecuador, a key U.S. ally in the region, rejected a proposal to host American troops in their country.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge ruled in favor of Meta in a major antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. The suit challenged Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp as illegal attempts to create a monopoly. The ruling ends a five-year federal campaign that sought to have the company spin off the social media platforms.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the tech world, cybersecurity firm Cloudflare suffered a major outage that temporarily took down prominent websites including X, ChatGPT, and Downdetector. Google has released its latest AI model, Gemini 3, which it says shows marked improvements in reasoning and coding performance. In a major partnership, Microsoft, Nvidia, and the AI company Anthropic have announced a new AI infrastructure deal that includes billions in new investments.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">At a Sotheby's auction Tuesday night, Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer" sold for $236.4 million, making it the most expensive modern artwork ever sold at auction. A solid gold toilet also sold for $12.1 million at the same event.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In entertainment news, a live-action film adaptation of "The Legend of Zelda" video game series is reportedly in development. In architecture, Barcelona's Sagrada Família has officially become the world's tallest church after workers placed the first part of a cross atop its central tower, which will reach over 564 feet upon completion.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Bucking a national trend of declining enrollment, the State University of New York (SUNY) system reported a 3% increase in student enrollment for the third consecutive year. University officials credited the growth to strategic initiatives aimed at attracting and retaining students.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s inbox reveal his extensive connections with prominent researchers at institutions like Harvard and MIT. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the emails show scholars asking the disgraced financier for funding, expressing gratitude for his support, and in some cases, seeking advice on how to handle sexual-misconduct allegations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Harvard University's Palestine Program for Health and Human Rights, housed within the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, is facing accusations of institutional bias. A report in The Editors details a recent webinar hosted by the program titled "Understanding Genocide through a Public Health Lens," which critics say presented a one-sided, "demonizing view of Israel" without debate. A 2025 report from Harvard's Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism had previously flagged the program for similar issues, noting that students experienced its events as promoting "bias and misinformation."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">George Bell, who spent 24 years in a maximum-security prison for a double homicide he did not commit, received a $17.5 million settlement from the City of New York. Bell was entirely innocent and had no connection to the murders for which he was convicted. According to The Bulwark, the district attorney at the time had sought the death penalty.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Investigators into last year's Baltimore bridge collapse found that the six construction workers who died might have survived if police had alerted them to the incoming ship. The investigation also determined that the crash was caused by a small, misplaced sticker on a wire.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A recent study suggests that city-dwelling raccoons are displaying early signs of domestication. According to Scientific American, urban raccoons appear to be evolving shorter snouts, a characteristic feature found in pets and other domesticated animals.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan V. Last outlines two potential futures for the Trump presidency. In an optimistic scenario, Trump's power peaks in 2025, followed by Democratic midterm victories that end his political movement. In a darker alternative, Trump uses extralegal measures and military actions to consolidate power. Last concludes that American democracy will not be secure until the Republican party itself returns to an affirmative commitment to liberalism. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/spoiler-we-win-trump-2026-midterms-2028">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/spoiler-we-win-trump-2026-midterms-2028</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in his newsletter Singal-Minded, Jesse Singal critiques what he terms journalism's "culture of casual calumny," using a recent newsletter by Taylor Lorenz as an example. He argues that this aggressive, attack-oriented style of punditry prioritizes reputational damage over factual understanding and is fueled by the negative incentives of an influencer-driven media environment. <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/i-hate-journalisms-culture-of-casual">https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/i-hate-journalisms-culture-of-casual</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch features an essay by Mary Speck arguing that the U.S. military's campaign against drug trafficking in the Caribbean and Pacific is unlikely to succeed, based on decades of the "war on drugs." Speck warns that efforts to achieve regime change in Venezuela could backfire, triggering chaos that empowers criminal organizations even further. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/venezuela-drugs-war-cartels-ineffective/">https://thedispatch.com/article/venezuela-drugs-war-cartels-ineffective/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his Slow Boring newsletter, Matthew Yglesias contends that if Democrats are serious about their new focus on "affordability," they must make difficult policy choices that may anger allied interest groups. He points to union opposition to transit automation in New York and environmentalist opposition to new energy infrastructure as examples where prioritizing cost-of-living would require tough political trade-offs, rather than just donning an "affordability skinsuit." <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices">https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times opinion section includes a piece by Jennifer Weiner arguing that Democrats, in their efforts to find damning information about Donald Trump, have weaponized the victims of Jeffrey Epstein. Separately, Michelle Cottle highlights the Republican women who were crucial in pushing for the release of the Epstein files. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/trump-epstein-files-democrats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/trump-epstein-files-democrats.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in The Editors, Robert L. Friedman critiques a webinar hosted by Harvard's Palestine Program for Health and Human Rights, calling it a biased, one-sided presentation that defined Israel's actions in Gaza as "genocide" without allowing for debate. He notes that the program's alleged institutional bias was previously cited by a Harvard presidential task force. <a href="https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization">https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Also in The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn examines the health care policies being proposed by Republicans as ACA subsidies near expiration. He argues that the central idea of giving money directly to individuals to "shop" for care has a poor track record, often leading people to forgo necessary medical treatment due to costs and an inability to navigate the complex system. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out</a></p></div>
