    <div class="content"><h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant reversal, President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to vote in favor of releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, stating, "we have nothing to hide." The move comes less than 48 hours before a planned bipartisan vote on the matter. This follows a period where the administration and GOP leadership worked to block the vote. The reversal has created a public feud between Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has championed the release of the files. Trump called her a "traitor," which Greene told CNN was "hurtful" and "extremely wrong." Separately, Trump announced he has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate potential links between Epstein and several prominent Democrats. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 23,000 documents from the Epstein estate, Trump is mentioned in 1,670 of the 2,324 email threads, more than any other prominent figure.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration signed an executive order lifting tariffs on a range of imported food products, including beef, coffee, fruit, and cocoa, in an effort to lower grocery prices. This move comes alongside a new trade deal with Switzerland that cuts tariffs on Swiss imports and includes a pledge from Swiss companies to invest $200 billion in the U.S. by 2028.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration has lifted all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed on 40 major airports. A CBS poll found that Americans believe Republicans "won" the shutdown by a margin of 55 percent to 6 percent, with a majority of Democrats thinking their party compromised too much.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times investigation found that the Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of agents from their regular duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, undermining other law enforcement operations, including those targeting child exploitation, sex trafficking, and terrorism financing. This shift is evident in recent crackdowns, such as the one in Charlotte, North Carolina, where masked Border Patrol agents began arresting people over the weekend. Additionally, President Trump has pardoned two more individuals for crimes related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The administration is pursuing an expansion of the U.S. government's list of foreign terrorist organizations to include left-wing groups in Europe linked to "antifa," as well as Latin American drug-trafficking organizations. Experts cited by The Washington Post called the move highly unusual.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal bankruptcy court judge approved OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits. The agreement requires the Sackler family, who owns the company, to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A report from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics revealed that former Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August, had made stock purchases that violated the central bank’s ethics code.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The transition of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is facing early tests. A key question is whether the Trump administration will grant him the top-level security clearance needed to be briefed on threats to the city. Mamdani's administration is also navigating internal political challenges; he has reportedly promised to back outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander’s potential primary challenge to Rep. Dan Goldman, a move that has irked the NYC Democratic Socialists of America (NYC-DSA), which has endorsed a different candidate. Despite these tensions, hundreds gathered at a DSA-organized rally in Union Square to support Mamdani's plans to tax the wealthy and fund universal child care.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mamdani's proposed corporate tax hikes have drawn sharp criticism from the business community. Steven Fulop, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, called the plan "absolute suicide." In an interview, Mamdani said he remains confident in his plan to keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner, though he stopped short of an official announcement. According to The New York Times, police officers are expressing a range of opinions on his administration, from uneasiness to open-mindedness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The race for New York City Council speaker is intensifying, with public forums scheduled for the candidates. According to City & State, the 17-member Brooklyn delegation, led by Democratic Party leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, is looking to unite as a voting bloc to increase its influence in the selection process.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul, in an interview with City & State, discussed lessons learned and her plans for her upcoming reelection bid. Meanwhile, Republican Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman is reportedly considering a run for governor in 2026.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new super PAC backed by the artificial intelligence industry, Leading the Future, announced it is launching a multimillion-dollar campaign to oppose Democratic Assemblymember Alex Bores in his primary campaign to succeed retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler. Bores is the sponsor of a state bill, the RAISE Act, which seeks to regulate the AI industry.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The state Gaming Facility Location Board is conducting site visits to the three remaining applicants for a downstate casino license: Bally’s in the Bronx, and Resorts World and Metropolitan Park in Queens. Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams is on a multiday farewell trip to Israel, where he is meeting with government officials and discussing efforts to combat antisemitism.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, rather than setting up a traditional state commission of inquiry. While leaders in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government claim the probe will have "full investigative authority," the Cabinet has not yet agreed on its organization or scope. Israel's High Court of Justice had previously told the government there was "no real argument" against forming a state commission.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to a report from Axios, the Israeli government is not opposed to a prospective U.S. sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, on the condition that the deal is accompanied by the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">British politics is experiencing a period of significant fracturing, according to The Dispatch. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party, which won a large majority just over a year ago, has seen its support collapse amid economic stagnation and voter anger over immigration. Starmer's approval rating has fallen to -48 percent. However, the opposition Conservative Party has been unable to capitalize, remaining similarly unpopular. This disillusionment with the two main parties has fueled the rise of the right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, which is now polling at 29 percent and threatening to supplant the Conservatives as the main party of the right.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced he is working to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia and is implementing changes to "reboot" the country's energy sector following corruption scandals. His efforts come as Russian missile and drone strikes hit Kyiv and Kharkiv, killing several people. Ukraine has continued to target Russian energy infrastructure in response.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Chile’s presidential election is heading to a December 14 runoff between Communist Party member Jeannette Jara and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast after no candidate secured an outright majority. Kast is considered the early favorite for the second round.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump indicated he is open to talks with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The comments came as the U.S. increases its military presence in the Caribbean, with the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier arriving in the region.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The New York Times, a growing number of patients are turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice. A survey found that about one in six adults consults AI for medical information. Users cited long wait times, inattentive doctors, and high costs in the traditional healthcare system as reasons for using the technology. While some doctors see potential benefits, such as more informed patients, they also express concern about the chatbots' potential to provide incomplete or fabricated answers for high-stakes health decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly plans to resign from his position as early as 2026, according to the Financial Times.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system or denying its researchers federal grants over alleged discrimination and antisemitic civil rights violations. The order temporarily thwarts the government's attempt to secure a $1.2 billion settlement from UCLA.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data shows that the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges began before the Trump administration. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, a 7 percent drop in foreign enrollment last fall was precipitated by waning interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures for this year suggest the trend will worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A report in The Chronicle of Higher Education notes that from 2013 to 2022, average donor participation by college alumni dropped from 8.7 percent to 5.6 percent, continuing a long-term decline.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a Thanksgiving news release, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett announced he is handing off the writing of the company's annual shareholder letter to Chairman Greg Abel, citing his advancing age.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Jewish Currents, Gabi Kirk argues that a new "antisemitism prevention" law in California is part of a campaign against ethnic studies and ironically hinders engagement with the evolving nature of Jewish identity. <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss">https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Dispatch, Oliver Jia examines how AI is reshaping our relationship with mortality, arguing that digital resurrections of deceased individuals are fraudulent substitutes that could lead to a world where accepting death becomes impossible. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/ai-death-resurrection-likeness-stan-lee/">https://thedispatch.com/article/ai-death-resurrection-likeness-stan-lee/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the Daily News, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Jamie Beran of Bend the Arc: Jewish Action write that amid the trauma of Oct. 7 and rising antisemitism, the Jewish community must confront deep tensions about what it means to be Jewish in the era of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42570141.34601/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTYvem9ocmFuLW1hbWRhbmktYW5kLW55Y3MtamV3cy13aGF0LWtpbmQtb2YtamV3aXNoLWNvbW11bml0eS1kby13ZS13YW50LXRvLWJlLz9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fCe6649ec9">https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42570141.34601/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTYvem9ocmFuLW1hbWRhbmktYW5kLW55Y3MtamV3cy13aGF0LWtpbmQtb2YtamV3aXNoLWNvbW11bml0eS1kby13ZS13YW50LXRvLWJlLz9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fCe6649ec9</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his Slow Boring newsletter, Matthew Yglesias contends that the Democratic senators who ended the government shutdown were not acting as "moderates." He argues that moderation is about aligning with public opinion on key issues, whereas the senators who folded were prioritizing specific policy outcomes (like protecting federal workers and appropriation levels) over a politically advantageous fight against President Trump. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn interviews Dr. Atul Gawande about the human cost of the Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Gawande argues the cuts have led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly among children, by halting aid for HIV, malnutrition, and other preventable conditions, calling it a "public man-made death now at large scale." <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times editorial board argues that while killing the U.S. penny was the right move, the Trump administration's method was flawed and should have been handled through legislation to ensure a smoother, less inflationary transition. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/penny-trump-coin.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/penny-trump-coin.html</a></p></div>
