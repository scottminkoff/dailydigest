    <h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 17, 2025 at 10:26 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Donald Trump abruptly reversed his position on the release of Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein, stating on Truth Social that House Republicans should vote to release them because "we have nothing to hide." This U-turn came less than 48 hours before a scheduled House vote on the matter and followed months of White House efforts to block the release. According to The Atlantic, the administration had engaged in high-level meetings to discuss the files and tried to pressure pro-release Republicans like Reps. Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump attacked Greene on Friday, calling her "wacky" and a "ranting Lunatic." His reversal is seen as a capitulation after realizing he was likely to lose the floor vote, handing a significant victory to Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, the bill's chief Republican sponsor.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his announcement, Trump urged Republicans to "get BACK ON POINT," listing 11 other topics, including the economy and affordability. The president is escalating a White House push on Americans' economic worries, planning to deliver a speech on affordability at a McDonald's summit. This push includes a recent executive order lifting tariffs on a range of imported food products like beef, coffee, and bananas. However, his attempts to focus on this message were overshadowed by his interventions on divisive issues within the MAGA movement. In addition to the Epstein files, Trump also defended Tucker Carlson's decision to interview white nationalist Nick Fuentes, stating, "If he wants to interview Nick Fuentes... get the word out. You know, people have to decide."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, a federal magistrate judge ruled that "government misconduct" and errors by lead prosecutor Lindsey Halligan may have imperiled the Justice Department's case against former FBI Director James Comey. The judge ordered prosecutors to turn over grand jury records to Comey's defense team. Separately, David Richardson resigned as the acting head of FEMA after facing criticism for his absence during the early hours of the Texas floods. The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether immigration officials can legally turn away foreigners who request asylum at a border crossing, a policy known as "metering." In North Carolina, Border Patrol agents conducted a major immigration sweep in Charlotte over the weekend, arresting more than 130 people in an operation dubbed "Charlotte's Web." And following the end of the government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that nationwide flight reductions would be lifted this morning.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">One of the first tests for Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be whether the Trump administration grants him a top-level security clearance, which is necessary for him to be briefed on threats to the city. According to POLITICO, while President Trump has used clearances as a tool for retribution, denying one to the mayor of New York City would be highly unusual. Mamdani's team has reached out to the White House to set up a meeting with the president. The mayor-elect is also navigating tensions within his own progressive coalition; his reported promise to back Comptroller Brad Lander in a potential primary against Rep. Dan Goldman has put him at odds with the NYC-DSA, which has endorsed City Council Member Alexa Avilés for that seat. In another move to the center, Mamdani has said he is confident in his plan to retain Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul, gearing up for what she says will be a "fight like hell" reelection bid, signaled that uncertainty in Washington could influence the state's tax calculus next year, potentially opening the door to tax hikes in her budget plan, though she remains opposed to increasing the personal income tax. She is also calling on the Trump administration to release federal home heating assistance funds. As Mamdani's agenda to tax the wealthy gains traction with supporters, who rallied in Union Square, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, Steven Fulop, called the idea "absolute suicide" for the city's economy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other city and state political news, Brooklyn City Council Member Chi Ossé has opened a fundraising account to run for Congress against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. In the race for City Council speaker, Reps. Nydia Velázquez and Yvette Clarke have endorsed Crystal Hudson. Meanwhile, Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, a Queens Democrat, announced she will not seek reelection in 2026. According to lobbying data from July and August, a bill to end a subsidy for new gas hookups was the most-lobbied piece of legislation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mets owner Steve Cohen has signed a deal with the city to build a casino on public land next to Citi Field, despite a recent court ruling that seemed to complicate the plan. A new report alleges that top City Hall and NYPD officials worked to undermine sexual harassment and retaliation claims against Timothy Pearson, a top adviser to Mayor Eric Adams. Separately, an NYPD officer was shot in the face with possible birdshot pellets in Brooklyn. In housing, NYCHA has updated its rules to give higher priority to tenants fleeing domestic violence.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-day trip to Israel, his last as mayor, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The visit is being billed as both a show of solidarity amid rising antisemitism and a farewell trip. The Forward notes it is likely the last international trip an NYC mayor will take to Israel for years, a point Adams sought to underscore.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, rather than setting up a traditional official state commission of inquiry. This comes after the High Court of Justice indicated there was "no real argument" against forming a state commission. On the diplomatic front, Axios reported that the Israeli government is not opposed to a potential Saudi Arabian purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets, provided the country also agrees to normalize relations with Israel. The U.N. Security Council is set to vote today on a U.S.-drafted resolution on Gaza that leaves open the possibility of Palestinian statehood, a concept Netanyahu reiterated his opposition to.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Political turmoil is brewing in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government is facing collapsing approval ratings. According to The Dispatch, economic stagnation and widespread anger over high immigration rates are fueling a potential fracture of the country's traditional two-party system. Support is growing for rivals, including the far-left Greens, the center-left Liberal Democrats, and particularly the right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, which is now polling near 30%.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In South America, President Trump stated he is open to discussions with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, even as the U.S. amasses its largest military presence in the Caribbean in decades, including the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. Trump told reporters he had "sort of" made a decision regarding potential military operations in Venezuela. Meanwhile, Chile's presidential election is headed for a December runoff between Communist Party candidate Jeannette Jara, who won a plurality in the first round, and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast, who is seen as the favorite in the head-to-head matchup.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is working to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia and has announced a shakeup in the country's energy sector amid corruption concerns. In Paris, he is seeking to purchase anti-missile systems as Russian strikes continue on Ukrainian cities. In international trade, the U.S. and Swiss governments have agreed to a deal that will cut tariffs on Swiss imports.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The landscape of sports viewership has become increasingly complicated for fans, with games fragmented across numerous streaming services like Prime Video, MSG+, Peacock, and traditional channels like ESPN. As detailed in The Atlantic, a fan of a single team, such as the New York Knicks, might need to subscribe to four or more different services to watch all of their team's games throughout a season.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the tech policy sphere, a new pro-artificial intelligence super PAC, Leading the Future, has named its first target: New York Assemblymember Alex Bores. The group, backed by over $100 million from the AI industry, is launching a multimillion-dollar campaign to oppose Bores' run for Congress, citing his sponsorship of the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, which the tech industry opposes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A weekend controversy erupted on the social media platform Bluesky after comedian Patton Oswalt was suspended for joking that media personality Megyn Kelly should be put through a woodchipper. The joke was in response to Kelly's comments on her show suggesting Jeffrey Epstein was "not a pedophile" but was instead into "barely legal" teenage girls. The incident has fueled a wider debate about free speech and moderation policies on the platform.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On the entertainment front, Ken Burns' new documentary series on the American Revolution premiered on PBS, and Netflix is set to release "Death by Lightning," a new drama series about the assassination of President James Garfield. In business news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly plans to resign as early as 2026.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from fining the University of California system. The administration had threatened to cut millions in research grants and levy a $1.2 billion settlement over alleged discrimination and antisemitic civil rights violations at UCLA. The judge ruled the administration's funding threats were "coercive."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data reveals that the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges began before the Trump presidency. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, waning interest in master's and professional programs contributed to a 7% drop in foreign enrollment last fall, with preliminary figures for this year suggesting the trend will worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In California, a new "antisemitism prevention" law is being analyzed by Jewish Currents as part of a longer-running campaign against ethnic studies curricula. The analysis argues the law erodes possibilities for robust education on both Palestine and the complexities of modern Jewish identity.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new analysis from Chalkbeat New York found that students in New York City's juvenile detention centers often have deep learning challenges and frequently do not receive the support needed to catch up academically.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Sid Davidoff, a veteran New York lobbyist and government relations expert who began his career as an aide to former Mayor John Lindsay, has died at the age of 86. In law enforcement news, recently retired NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Community Affairs Mark Stewart was awarded an unusually lucrative disability pension, similar to a generous benefit previously given to former Chief of Department John Chell. In finance, the U.S. Mint has reportedly made its last penny, and stores are preparing for the new math of rounding cash transactions. U.S. pennies are made mostly of zinc, plated with copper.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch's Nick Catoggio argues that the rebellion against Donald Trump over the Epstein files, led by figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene, is a significant moment in the MAGA era. It represents the first successful challenge to the president's supremacy as the arbiter of populist orthodoxy, suggesting that "MAGA populism has discrete ideological content beyond the president’s whims." Greene's willingness to question Trump's motives and endure his wrath has created a schism, transforming a pseudo-religious movement into one where loyalty may now be owed to ideology rather than solely to the leader. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/losing-my-religion-marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-epstein-files/">Read more at The Dispatch.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias contends that the decision by eight Democratic senators to end the government shutdown was not an act of "moderation." Instead, he writes, it was a choice to prioritize immediate, substantive policy outcomes—protecting federal workers from hardship and securing higher appropriations levels—over a politically advantageous but painful fight. Yglesias argues that true moderation involves aligning with public opinion on major issues, not folding a "winning political hand" for inside-baseball policy gains. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">Read more at Slow Boring.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Chronicle of Higher Education, John W. White asserts that "secret rules" now govern what can be taught in Florida's public universities. Recounting his experience being told by administrators to change his course materials for a class on "Race and Law" because they might run afoul of state law, he notes there was no specific statute or written rule to justify the demand. This creates a chilling effect where faculty are forced to self-censor based on vague, unwritten directives to avoid potential repercussions. <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/secret-rules-now-govern-what-can-be-taught-in-florida">Read more at The Chronicle of Higher Education.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gabi Kirk writes in Jewish Currents that a new "antisemitism prevention" law in California, which mandates the use of a specific definition of antisemitism in anti-discrimination policies, is not just about protecting Jewish students. She argues it's part of a long-running campaign by mainstream Jewish organizations to counter the ethnic studies movement and suppress criticism of Israel, and that it ironically makes it harder for educators to engage with the complex and shifting conditions of modern Jewish identity. <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss">Read more at Jewish Currents.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the Daily News, Melissa Mark-Viverito, Abraham Paulos and Rosa Cohen-Cruz argue that New Yorkers elected a government to fight back against President Trump and protect all residents, including immigrants. They call on the new administration to uphold and strengthen the city's sanctuary policies and resist any federal attempts to co-opt local law enforcement for immigration raids. <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/11/16/maintain-sanctuary-in-new-york-city/?oref=csny_firstread_nl">Read more at the Daily News.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Assembly Member Micah Lasher, also in the Daily News, proposes a "game plan for House Democrats to fight back" against the Trump administration. He urges them to throw "sand in the works" at every opportunity, using procedural tools to obstruct and delay, making it clear that Democrats stand in total opposition to the chaos and corruption being perpetrated by Trump and his allies in Congress. <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/11/17/a-game-plan-for-house-democrats-to-fight-back/?oref=csny_firstread_nl">Read more at the Daily News.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Jamie Beran of Bend the Arc: Jewish Action write for the Daily News that in the face of rising antisemitism and authoritarianism, the Jewish community must confront deep tensions about what it means to be Jewish. They argue for a community that embraces diversity, stands for multiracial democracy, and engages in "good-faith, if sharp-elbowed, debate," rather than one that demands conformity or silence, especially regarding Israel and Palestine. <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/11/16/zohran-mamdani-and-nycs-jews-what-kind-of-jewish-community-do-we-want-to-be/?oref=csny_firstread_nl">Read more at the Daily News.</a></p></div>
