<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
A year into his second term, President Trump’s approval rating has dropped to 40 percent, erasing gains made among young and nonwhite voters during the election. The shift appears driven primarily by economic dissatisfaction, with 64 percent of voters disapproving of his handling of the cost of living, while Democrats now hold a five-point lead on the generic congressional ballot. The coalition that elected Trump has largely unraveled, reverting to 2020 polling patterns where he retains older white voters but loses the diverse coalition he briefly assembled.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The Supreme Court appears poised to block President Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, with a majority of justices expressing skepticism about the administration's claim of unreviewable executive authority. During oral arguments, justices from across the ideological spectrum raised concerns that allowing the firing without due process or factual review would "shatter" the Fed's independence. The court seems inclined to allow Cook to remain in her post while litigation regarding the alleged mortgage fraud—which the administration cited as cause for removal—proceeds in lower courts.

A leaked internal memo from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) instructs agents that they may forcibly enter homes without a judicial warrant if a judge has issued a final removal order. This directive contradicts the agency's public training materials on Fourth Amendment rights and is currently being used to train new officers despite whistleblower complaints. The revelation comes as Vice President JD Vance travels to Minnesota to highlight the administration's crackdown on sanctuary cities and celebrate ICE's enforcement efforts.

The Environmental Protection Agency has ceased estimating the monetary value of human lives saved when setting limits on fine particulate matter and ozone pollutants. This change in cost-benefit analysis methodology assigns a value of zero dollars to human life in these specific calculations, a significant shift from previous federal standards. Critics warn this could lead to looser controls on industrial pollution from refineries and power plants by skewing the economic calculus against regulation.

A Manhattan judge has ruled that New York’s 11th Congressional District, currently held by Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, violates the state constitution and must be redrawn by February 6. The ruling, which cites discrimination against minority voters, could transform the Staten Island-based seat into a Democratic stronghold just ahead of petitioning season. This decision reopens the redistricting process and could significantly impact the battle for control of the House of Representatives.

Prominent New York Democrats, including Reps. Jerry Nadler and Greg Meeks, are publicly pressuring Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado to drop his primary challenge against Gov. Kathy Hochul. Party leaders argue the challenge is a "distraction" and a waste of resources needed to flip House seats, citing polling that shows Hochul leading Delgado by over 40 points. Delgado's supporters counter that the establishment is disconnected and that voters deserve a choice regarding the governor's handling of housing and affordability.

Gov. Kathy Hochul’s executive budget includes several under-the-radar policy proposals, including a "ZYN tax" that would apply the wholesale tobacco tax to non-tobacco nicotine products. Other measures include requiring speed-limiting technology in vehicles for repeat speeders, banning federal immigration arrests at sensitive locations like schools without a warrant, and allowing state lawsuits against federal immigration officers. The budget also proposes extending mayoral control of NYC schools for four years.

Eric Adams’ reelection campaign failed to disclose over $100,000 in payments to his 2025 campaign manager, Eugene Noh, and associated LLCs. Noh confirmed receiving the payments for salary and field staff expenses, attributing the lack of disclosure to "disorganization," though the Campaign Finance Board could levy significant fines. This comes amid broader investigations into Adams' campaign finances and potential clawbacks of public matching funds.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to join President Trump's "Board of Peace," alongside nations like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar, though he will not attend the Davos ceremony due to ICC arrest warrant concerns. Trump claimed at Davos that Hamas has agreed to disarm, warning they will be "blown away" if they do not comply within weeks. Meanwhile, Israel Police have broken with the status quo by permitting Jews to enter the Temple Mount compound with printed prayer pages.

After threatening to acquire Greenland by any means necessary, President Trump announced he reached a "framework of a future deal" with NATO and Denmark regarding the Arctic region. Trump stated the U.S. would not use military force to seize the island but maintained that the deal involves indefinite American defense commitments and potentially expanded base rights. In response to Trump's earlier tariff threats, the European Union has frozen ratification of a trade deal with the United States.

At the World Economic Forum, President Trump hosted a signing ceremony for his "Board of Peace," which includes nearly two dozen countries but notably lacks traditional Western allies like France, Sweden, and the UK. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a speech urging "middle powers" to resist submission to great powers and instead build new alliances, signaling a potential rupture in the traditional US-led order. Corporate executives at Davos reportedly gave Trump's speech warm reviews, contrasting with the stunned reaction of European political leaders.

The crypto industry has seen significant regulatory relief under the Trump administration, with the SEC dropping cases against major firms like Coinbase and Kraken.

While industry advocates celebrate the ability to grow domestically without fear of enforcement, critics argue the deregulation erodes essential financial guardrails.

The U.S. homicide rate in 2025 is likely the lowest it has been in 125 years, according to a new analysis of crime data. This historic decline challenges prevailing political narratives about rising crime and lawlessness.

David French argues that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech at Davos marks a pivotal moment where "middle power" democracies are choosing resistance over submission to Trump's America. French suggests that Trump's antagonism toward allies—exemplified by his threats to NATO members and the Greenland dispute—is inadvertently fostering a rival power bloc of nations that will coordinate economically and militarily without the United States. He concludes that Trump's attempt to turn allies into vassals is backfiring, leaving America more isolated and less secure.

Jonah Goldberg critiques Ross Douthat's analysis of the "new right," arguing that Trumpism may not be a durable political philosophy capable of being inherited by successors like JD Vance. Goldberg contends that true conservatism is grounded in continuity and abstract principles (like free markets and constitutionalism), whereas the "new right" is defined by a situational populism that often ignores trade-offs and facts. He warns that redefining "the right" to include authoritarian or statist impulses essentially voids the meaning of conservatism itself.
