    <h4>November 19, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 19, 2025 at 2:03 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a rare show of bipartisanship, Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill to compel the Justice Department to release its files on the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The House approved the measure 427-1, with the Senate later passing it by unanimous consent. President Trump, who had previously lobbied against the bill and criticized reporters for asking about it, is now expected to sign it into law. According to The Dispatch, Attorney General Pam Bondi will retain the power to withhold information that identifies victims or impairs ongoing federal investigations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new poll from The New York Times and KFF reveals that while about half of all immigrants in the U.S. feel less safe since President Trump took office, roughly 70 percent would still choose to migrate to the country. The survey found that a majority of immigrants, including those who are undocumented, feel they are on their way to achieving the American dream. However, fear of Trump's immigration crackdown has led about a third of noncitizen immigrants to avoid routine activities like travel or going to work. Separately, Texas Governor Greg Abbott officially designated the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as a "foreign terrorist organization."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to dismantle the Department of Education by outsourcing at least six of its offices, including grant-making programs that support college access, to other federal agencies. This follows the administration's earlier decision to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which cut 83% of its projects and transferred the rest to the State Department. According to The Dispatch, this shift has moved U.S. foreign aid away from long-term resilience projects, such as agricultural and health initiatives, toward a narrower focus on short-term crisis response. A study in The Lancet estimated the cancellation of USAID programs could result in 14 million preventable deaths by 2030.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal court has blocked Texas's new congressional map, ruling that "substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map," according to The Dispatch. Governor Greg Abbott has stated he will appeal the decision.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire, Republicans are floating various policy ideas. According to The Bulwark, proposals range from Senator Rick Scott's plan to give people money to buy their own coverage to Senator Bill Cassidy's more limited idea of using the funds for private accounts to cover out-of-pocket costs. President Trump posted on social media that he would only support sending money "directly back to the people," allowing them to "buy their own, much better, insurance."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">ProPublica reports that the White House intervened on behalf of Andrew Tate, the online influencer who faces rape and human-trafficking charges in Europe, during a federal investigation.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral race, President Trump’s border czar Tom Homan said he plans to ramp up immigration enforcement operations in the city. Several local elected officials have vowed not to be intimidated by the move. This comes as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indefinitely canceled naturalization ceremonies in at least seven upstate counties, leaving hundreds of aspiring citizens in limbo, according to the Times Union.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Kathy Hochul's administration announced it will close the Bare Hill Correctional Facility in the North Country due to persistent staffing shortages. The decision has drawn criticism from both Republican lawmakers, who called it "dangerous," and prison reform advocates, who argue it fails to address issues of brutality and inmate deaths within the system. No layoffs are expected.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the final weeks of his term, Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-day trip to Uzbekistan, which the New York Post reports is a taxpayer-funded tour as he hunts for a new job. Meanwhile, a Manhattan federal judge, while sentencing a former aide in a straw-donor scheme for Adams's campaign, criticized "a notable absence here of the person at the apex of the pyramid."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Council Member Chi Ossé is seeking the endorsement of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America for his primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to City & State, Ossé, who only recently joined the organization, will make his case to members at a closed-door forum.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A key difference is emerging between potential Republican gubernatorial candidates for 2026. According to Politico, Rep. Elise Stefanik opposes abortion with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, while Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman identifies as a "pro-choice Republican." The opposing stances could play a significant role in a primary versus a general election in the blue state.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Adams administration announced it will add 10,000 after-school seats at 75 schools and 11 community centers for the fall of 2026. In other school news, parents continue to report issues with school bus services as the city considers a contract extension for bus companies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A City Council commission is set to vote on a package of proposed charter amendments, including one that would create a new process for the public and the council to remove a mayor for "malfeasance."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">One man was killed and three others were injured in a terrorist attack at the Gush Etzion Junction in the West Bank after two Palestinian men drove their car into a crowd and then began stabbing people. Israeli security forces fatally shot both attackers and found explosives in their vehicle. One of the injured, a woman in her 50s, is in critical condition after reportedly being mistakenly hit by Israeli gunfire.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israel Defense Forces conducted an airstrike in Lebanon on what it described as a Hamas training and "military compound" located in the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp. According to Lebanese authorities, 13 people were killed. Hamas denied having any military installations in Lebanon's refugee camps and claimed the strike hit a group of boys playing in a sports field.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An Israeli human rights organization released a report claiming that at least 94 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have died while in Israeli custody over the last two years. The group alleged a pattern of cover-ups and targeted killings.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump welcomed Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House for a lavish state dinner, hailing him as a "best friend." According to Politico and The New York Times, Trump defended the prince from questions about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence concluded bin Salman ordered. During the visit, the two countries signed an agreement for the U.S. to sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and a declaration for cooperation on civil nuclear energy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly on the verge of a peace agreement with Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, according to Axios and Politico. The plan was said to be formulated during talks between White House envoy Steve Witkoff and a Russian negotiator, with no direct input from Ukraine or European allies. A White House official told Politico, "We don't really care about the Europeans. It's about Ukraine accepting." Meanwhile, Russia launched a major attack with 48 missiles and 476 drones into Western Ukraine, killing at least 16 people in Ternopil.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has reportedly approved covert CIA measures inside Venezuela, according to The New York Times. The move comes as the U.S. continues a campaign against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, an operation with an unclear strategy regarding its goal of either ousting President Nicolás Maduro or combating drug trafficking more broadly.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that two Ukrainians accused of working for Russia are suspected of being behind a recent railway line explosion in the country. He added that the suspects have already fled.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An investigation by The New York Times and The Examination, a nonprofit newsroom, uncovered widespread lead poisoning in Ogijo, Nigeria. The lead dust originates from factories recycling old car batteries, with the extracted lead often used to make new batteries for American cars. The report highlights how lax environmental enforcement in Nigeria contrasts with aggressive policing of lead pollution in wealthier nations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ecuadorian voters rejected a proposal to host U.S. troops in the country. The country's president, an ally of President Trump, had supported the plan.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Google has released Gemini 3, its latest AI model, which it says markedly improves upon previous versions in reasoning and coding performance. In other AI news, Microsoft has partnered with Nvidia and AI company Anthropic in a new infrastructure deal. As part of the agreement, Nvidia will invest $5 billion and Microsoft will invest $10 billion in Anthropic, which in turn will purchase $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A portrait by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, "Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer," sold for over $236.4 million at a Sotheby's auction. According to The New York Times, this makes it the second most expensive painting ever sold at auction and the most expensive modern artwork.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge ruled in favor of Meta in a significant antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote that Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp did not constitute illegal attempts to monopolize a market, ending a five-year federal campaign against the company.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Cybersecurity firm Cloudflare experienced a major four-hour outage that took down numerous websites, including X, ChatGPT, and the outage-tracking site Downdetector.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Toyota announced it will invest $912 million in its American plants across five southern states to increase the production of hybrid vehicles. This investment is part of a larger plan to invest up to $10 billion in the U.S. by 2030.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Sagrada Família in Barcelona has become the world's tallest church after workers placed the first part of a cross atop its central tower. The church will reach over 564 feet when the cross is completed in the coming months.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As the Trump administration moves to outsource some functions of the Department of Education, newly released documents provide insight into Jeffrey Epstein's connections within academia. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, Epstein's emails reveal deep ties to prominent researchers who sought funding from the disgraced financier, expressed gratitude for his support, and in some cases, sought his advice on how to handle sexual-misconduct allegations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Harvard historian Jill Lepore told The Chronicle of Higher Education that she nearly quit the university due to what she described as a "miserable" and "prosecutorial culture." While she ultimately stayed, she now regrets her silence at the time.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A story highlighted in The Bulwark recounts the case of George Bell, who was wrongfully convicted of a double homicide and spent 24 years in a maximum-security prison. After his exoneration in 2021, the City of New York awarded him $17.5 million, its largest-ever settlement for a wrongful conviction. Bell had been completely innocent and had nothing to do with the murders for which the District Attorney had originally sought the death penalty.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Investigators into the Baltimore bridge collapse last year found that the six construction workers who died might have survived if police had alerted them to the approaching ship. The report also concluded that the crash was caused by a small, misplaced sticker on a wire.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Curaçao, a Caribbean island with a population of about 185,000, has become the smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup following a 0-0 draw with Jamaica. In related news, the BBC reports the U.S. will give visa appointment priority to World Cup ticket holders.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan V. Last makes the case that American democracy may be on the "downslope" of the threat posed by Donald Trump, citing recent political setbacks for the president and the resilience of some institutional guardrails. Last argues that if Democrats perform well in the 2026 midterms, it could force Trump to declare his 2028 intentions early, likely ending his third-term ambitions. However, he warns that the Republican party's underlying illiberalism remains a long-term threat that cannot be solved simply by one party winning elections. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/spoiler-we-win-trump-2026-midterms-2028">Read the full opinion at The Bulwark.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing in his Substack newsletter, Jesse Singal critiques what he calls the "culture of casual calumny" in modern journalism, using a recent newsletter by Taylor Lorenz about AI researchers as an example. Singal argues that this style of attack-dog punditry, which privileges accusation over explanation, is geared more toward demonstrating ideological bona fides than getting at the truth, ultimately making actual journalism harder to do. <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/i-hate-journalisms-culture-of-casual">Read the full opinion at Singal-Minded.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jonathan Cohn, writing for The Bulwark, analyzes the new health care policy ideas being rushed out by Republicans to address the looming expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. He argues that the central concept of "consumer-driven health care"—giving people money directly to shop for insurance or pay for care—is a decades-old idea that has been repeatedly shown not to work, as most people do not "shop" for health care and are more likely to cut back on necessary care when faced with high out-of-pocket costs. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/not-so-impressive-new-health-care-policy-ideas-republicans-rush-out">Read the full opinion at The Bulwark.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, Jennifer Weiner writes that in their eagerness to find something damning about President Trump, Democrats have weaponized the victims in the Jeffrey Epstein story. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/trump-epstein-democrats.html">Read the full opinion at The New York Times.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Also in The New York Times, Michelle Cottle highlights the Republican women who played a key role in pushing for the release of the Epstein files, defying pressure from the White House. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/opinion/epstein-republican-women-congress.html">Read the full opinion at The New York Times.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his newsletter Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias argues that if Democrats are truly committed to a message focused on "affordability," they must be prepared to make difficult policy choices that confront friendly interest groups. He points to examples like transit unions opposing cost-saving automation in New York City's subway and environmental groups blocking energy pipelines, suggesting that politicians too often wear an "affordability skinsuit" while prioritizing other goals. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/affordability-means-hard-choices">Read the full opinion at Slow Boring.</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Editors, Robert L. Friedman critiques a recent webinar hosted by the Palestine Program for Health and Human Rights at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He argues the event was "one-sided table-pounding" that presented a "demonizing view of Israel" and obsessively focused on labeling its actions as "genocide" without debate or alternative perspectives, noting that it proceeded even after a university task force had faulted the program for "bias and misinformation." <a href="https://www.theeditors.com/p/unbridled-brutality-of-israeli-genocide-harvard-fxb-chan-school-public-health-bias-demonization">Read the full opinion at The Editors.</a></p>
