<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, during a traffic stop confrontation in Minneapolis, sparking protests and a sharp partisan divide over video footage of the incident. While Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem labeled Good a "domestic terrorist," Minnesota Governor Tim Walz disputed the characterization and activated the National Guard, highlighting a growing conflict between state and federal authorities. In an interview with the <i>New York Times</i>, President Trump reviewed slow-motion footage of the shooting, calling it a "terrible scene" while maintaining that Good "behaved horribly."

The Senate is voting on a war powers resolution introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine to limit President Trump's ability to conduct further military strikes in Venezuela following the capture of Nicolás Maduro. While five Republicans—including Susan Collins and Rand Paul—joined Democrats in advancing the measure, it faces an expected veto from the President if it passes the House. Senator Todd Young supported the move to assert Congress’s constitutional role, prompting Trump to post on Truth Social that the dissenting Republicans "should never be elected to office again."

The Trump administration released new dietary guidelines that invert the traditional food pyramid, prioritizing proteins like steak and whole milk while discouraging processed foods and refined carbohydrates. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated his message was simply to "eat real food," though some recommendations, such as cooking with beef tallow, lack robust scientific backing. Additionally, new alcohol guidelines vaguely suggest limiting consumption without setting specific caps, with CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz noting alcohol is a "social lubricant."

Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel appears to be testing the waters for a 2028 presidential run, positioning himself as a center-left alternative to the current Democratic trajectory. Emanuel is focusing on issues like border security and the negative impact of extended school closures during the pandemic, criticizing his party for "keeping school doors closed way too long." He argues that a candidate must separate themselves from the pack by acknowledging where the party has failed working-class voters.

Governor Kathy Hochul and NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani are announcing a joint plan to expand universal child care, starting with a statewide expansion of universal pre-K. Despite political differences, the two leaders are collaborating on a "2-Care" program to provide free child care for 2-year-olds in New York City, funded by state dollars. Hochul framed the initiative as a "concrete roadmap that will transform the lives of working parents and kids across our state."

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Israel’s Construction and Housing Ministry has issued a tender for 3,401 housing units in the controversial E1 area east of Jerusalem, a move that critics say would effectively bisect the West Bank. The construction plans, delayed for years due to international pressure, are viewed as a significant blow to the viability of a future continuous Palestinian state. The advancement of these units is expected to draw "sharp criticism worldwide."

The enclave features synagogues, Shabbat dinners, and Hebrew signage on surfboards, reflecting a desire to maintain cultural identity while escaping the "warlike" atmosphere at home. As one expat noted, "The farther you are from Israel, the closer you want to be to it."

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Following the capture of Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration has signaled it plans to "run" Venezuela's oil industry for the foreseeable future to stabilize global prices. While sanctions are being selectively rolled back to allow oil exports to the U.S., the administration is backing Maduro's former vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, as an interim leader despite her deep ties to the previous regime. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined a transition plan focused on stability and economic recovery, but noted it is "far too premature" to discuss new elections.

Protests have erupted across Iran in response to rapid currency inflation, resulting in clashes with security forces and the reported deaths of 38 people. The unrest comes as the regime executed Ali Ardestani, who was convicted in a closed-door trial of spying for Israel’s Mossad. An Israeli security analyst noted that the regime may be "dragged into a reality of ongoing protests without resolution," increasing the likelihood of extreme internal or external responses.

This corporate battle continues to reshape the media landscape as legacy studios struggle to adapt to the streaming era.

The <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> announced it will cease publication in May after 240 years, following the Supreme Court's refusal to halt a lower court order regarding union health insurance. The newspaper's owner, Block Communications, cited losses of over $350 million and inflexible operational practices imposed by a 2014 labor contract as reasons for the closure. This leaves the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, home to 1.2 million people, without a daily newspaper specifically dedicated to covering the city.

Congress has effectively rejected the Trump administration's proposal to slash funding for scientific research, indicating that funding will remain steady at three key agencies. This legislative pushback preserves billions of dollars for academic and scientific endeavors that the White House had targeted for cuts. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for universities reliant on federal grants for research operations.

The small arrow on a car's fuel gauge that indicates which side the gas cap is on is known as a "Moylan arrow," named after the Ford employee Jim Moylan who proposed it in 1986. Moylan recently passed away, prompting a look back at the origins of this ubiquitous but often overlooked piece of user interface design. Prior to its adoption, drivers often had to guess or remember the fuel door location, a frustration Moylan sought to eliminate.

<b>Why "FAFO" signifies linguistic maturity.</b> John McWhorter argues that the Trump administration's use of the acronym "FAFO" regarding Venezuela, while crude, reflects a positive evolution where English is shedding "antimacassar notions about the body." He traces the history of the F-word from common usage to taboo and back again, suggesting its normalization allows for more honest communication. He concludes, "I’m still happy to see us getting over... prudery incommensurate with how a great many of us live, think, feel and speak."

<b>The ICE shooting reveals a fascist worldview.</b> Jonathan V.

He contrasts the demonization of Good with the lionization of Ashli Babbitt, noting both were treated according to their political alignment with the regime rather than the threat they posed. Last warns, "The people who run this regime do not understand law enforcement as an institution to be stewarded... And their 'enemies' include about half of America."

<b>Democrats should embrace American fossil fuels.</b> Matthew Yglesias argues that Democrats should stop trying to stifle domestic oil and gas production and instead focus on reducing consumption through technology, similar to the approaches of Norway and Canada. He contends that blocking supply is politically disastrous in key swing states and strategically unsound given current global technology limitations. Yglesias writes, "Given the actual state of technology, it’s a win-win-win for the American economy, for climate, and for American national security to try to get people to use American fossil fuels rather than imports."

<b>Trump is reviving a dangerous 19th-century foreign policy.</b> David French criticizes the Trump administration's raid on Venezuela as a return to "gunboat diplomacy" and a rejection of the just-war theory and international order established after WWII. He argues that by acting unilaterally and treating war as a "mere continuation of policy," the U.S. encourages a world where strong nations dominate the weak, eventually leading to global conflict. French warns, "If the United States joins Russia and China in their approach to armed conflict... then the Western postwar consensus is truly dead."
