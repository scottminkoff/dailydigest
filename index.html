<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Congressional leaders have released the text of a significant compromise deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon, and other agencies, making a government shutdown less likely ahead of the January 30 deadline. The proposed package maintains Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding at $10 billion while adding requirements for body cameras and independent oversight, though it excludes deeper changes sought by some Democrats. The legislation also bolsters defense spending while keeping domestic agency funding relatively flat, rejecting many of the steeper cuts proposed by the Trump administration.

The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments regarding President Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a case that could determine the future independence of the central bank. The dispute pits Solicitor General John Sauer against former Solicitor General Paul Clement, with the Court previously indicating in a related stay that the Fed is a "uniquely structured" entity protected from at-will presidential removal. Observers are closely watching Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, as their votes could form a majority alongside the liberal justices to protect the Fed's autonomy.

Lindsey Halligan has officially departed the Justice Department after a federal district judge ruled her appointment as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was unlawful. Halligan’s office had filed high-profile indictments against figures such as James Comey and Letitia James, cases that were subsequently dismissed following her disqualification. Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized the circumstances of the removal as "deeply misguided" in a statement confirming the departure.

The Supreme Court has issued a ruling allowing federal candidates to challenge state election laws before an election occurs, rather than waiting until results are contested. In a separate voting rights development, federal district courts in Oregon and California dismissed Department of Justice lawsuits seeking unredacted voter lists, citing a lack of federal authority to demand such sensitive records. Meanwhile, a three-judge panel denied a motion to block California's new congressional map, allowing it to remain in effect for the upcoming primary and general elections.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Governor Kathy Hochul unveiled a $260 billion executive budget proposal that increases spending by $6 billion without raising income or corporate tax rates. The plan closes a projected $4.2 billion gap thanks to higher-than-expected tax receipts and includes significant investments in school aid, Medicaid, and a $1.2 billion increase for child care subsidies. However, the proposal projects a budget gap of $12.5 billion by fiscal year 2030, raising concerns about long-term fiscal stability among fiscal watchdogs.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s pledge to build 200,000 units of affordable housing using exclusively union labor faces significant financial and logistical hurdles. Budget experts and former officials warn that the $100 billion price tag and union requirements could make the ambitious production targets nearly impossible to hit given current fiscal constraints. While labor leaders praised Mamdani's moral compass for the commitment, they acknowledged that implementing such a mandate will be a complex process.

The New York State Senate has passed legislation to allow county boards of elections to establish portable early voting locations to improve voter access. Additionally, the chamber passed a bill creating new criminal offenses for spreading false election information or engaging in voter suppression. Both measures now move to the Assembly for consideration.

The Ulster County Resource Recovery Agency is backing proposed state legislation that would mandate low-waste product packaging, estimating it could save the county up to $1 million. The "Packaging Reduction and Recycling Infrastructure Act" aims to shift the cost of recycling from taxpayers to producers, requiring a 50% reduction in packaging over 12 years. Local officials believe this legislation is essential as current recycling markets are volatile and costly for municipalities.

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Candidates vying for Rep. Jerry Nadler’s congressional seat in NY-12 are largely aligning against describing Israel's military campaign in Gaza as genocide. In Working Families Party questionnaires, leading contenders like Jack Schlossberg, Alex Bores, and Micah Lasher indicated they would not support resolutions labeling the conflict a genocide or blocking certain arms sales to Israel. This stance contrasts with neighboring districts where candidates are taking more critical positions on Israel's actions.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also added his name to the initiative, joining a disparate group of nations including Hungary, Belarus, and Vietnam. However, multiple European countries are reportedly considering ending their involvement in a separate U.S.-supported coordination center for Gaza due to frustrations with progress.

President Trump has arrived in Davos for the World Economic Forum amid escalating tensions with European allies over his stated desire to acquire Greenland. European leaders have reacted sharply to Trump's tariff threats, with the EU exploring the use of its "anti-coercion instrument" to retaliate economically if necessary. While Trump claims the acquisition is "psychologically needed for success," Danish and Greenlandic officials have firmly rejected the idea, sparking a diplomatic standoff that threatens the cohesion of the NATO alliance.

Global fertility rates have fallen to 2.2 children per woman, nearing the replacement rate of 2.1, with China recording its lowest birth rate since 1949. Demographers attribute the decline to long-term trends such as increased education for women, urbanization, and changing social roles, noting that government incentives to boost fertility have largely failed. The shrinking workforce relative to the retiree population poses significant future fiscal challenges for social safety nets worldwide.

The Australian parliament passed new gun control and hate speech legislation following a mass shooting at a Hanukkah celebration in Sydney. The measures include a national gun buyback program and increased penalties for advocating violence, though the hate speech bill faced opposition from the Greens party over free speech concerns. The legislation marks the most significant change to Australian firearms laws since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre reforms.

President Trump signed the "Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act," reversing Obama-era school lunch rules, while the HHS released new dietary guidelines removing preferences for low-fat milk. The administration has promoted the shift with viral videos featuring RFK Jr., framing it as an end to the "war on saturated fats," though the actual guidelines retain limits on saturated fat intake. Experts note the changes align with shifting scientific consensus on whole milk but criticize the politicized rollout.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Matthew Yglesias argues against the common critique that liberalism is responsible for the modern crisis of meaning or lack of community. He posits that the "crisis of liberalism" was caused by Donald Trump's victory, rather than Trump's victory being a consequence of liberalism's failure to provide meaning. Yglesias contends that macroeconomic management and foreign policy were the actual areas of liberal failure, not the philosophical tenets regarding community.

Ross Douthat and Anne Applebaum analyze President Trump's lack of restraint in his second term, specifically highlighting his erratic behavior regarding Greenland and Norway.

Applebaum argues that Trump's letter to Norway complaining about the Nobel Prize and demanding Greenland indicates he is living in a "different reality" that requires a firm response from Republicans.

Polling data reveals a consistent gender gap where women are significantly more likely than men to select "I don't know" in response to survey questions, regardless of the topic. This trend persists across demographics, with exceptions only found in questions related to parenting or child safety, where women express more certainty. The author suggests this reflects a tendency among women to hold themselves to a higher standard of knowledge before expressing an opinion, rather than an actual lack of knowledge.

In a review of Charlotte Beradt’s <i>The Third Reich of Dreams</i>, Raphael Magarik explores how dreams collected during the Nazi era reveal the psychological invasion of totalitarianism. While the book is often used to draw tidy analogies to modern authoritarianism, Magarik argues the dreams actually reveal complex webs of conflict rather than simple binaries of heroes and victims. He connects this historical analysis to the surreal nature of living under the current political climate.
