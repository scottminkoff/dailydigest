  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, an American citizen, during an operation in Minneapolis, sparking immediate conflicting narratives between federal and local officials. While Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem labeled Good a "domestic terrorist," Minnesota Governor Tim Walz disputed the federal account and has prepared the National Guard for potential unrest. During an interview with the <em>New York Times</em>, President Trump watched footage of the incident, remarking that "it's a terrible scene" while maintaining that Good "behaved horribly."

  The Senate advanced a war powers resolution intended to limit President Trump’s authority to conduct further military strikes in Venezuela without congressional approval. Five Republicans joined Democrats in the procedural vote, signaling a rare rebuke of the president and highlighting GOP divisions over the administration's long-term plans for the South American nation. Senator Susan Collins justified her vote by citing disagreement with Trump’s stated plan for "running" Venezuela and controlling its oil.

  The Trump administration released new federal dietary guidelines that radically restructure the traditional food pyramid, prioritizing proteins and fats like butter and beef tallow while placing grains at the bottom. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated his message is simply to "eat real food," criticizing decades of government incentives for processed options. The guidelines also loosened recommendations on alcohol, removing specific daily drink limits in favor of a general suggestion to limit consumption.

<h4><b>2. NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
  Democratic socialist Assemblymember Claire Valdez has launched a campaign for the congressional seat currently held by retiring Rep. Nydia Velázquez, setting up a primary battle against Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. Valdez is entering the race with the support of advisers close to New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, seeking to expand the socialist movement's influence in Washington. Valdez framed her candidacy as a need for a labor organizer who will "confront oligarchy and fascism" and offer a distinct economic agenda.

  New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani are jointly announcing a plan to establish a pathway to universal child care, beginning with the expansion of universal pre-K statewide. The proposal includes a specific "2-Care" initiative for New York City to provide free care for 2-year-olds, with the state committing funds for the first two years. This partnership highlights a strategic alignment between the governor and the new mayor on affordability issues despite potential political friction elsewhere.

  Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s first week in office has been marked by controversy, including the revocation of executive orders protecting Jewish New Yorkers and the appointment of a tenant protection head who previously called private property a "weapon of white supremacy." Staffers at City Hall reportedly began raising objections regarding the mayor's conduct and appointments within hours of his inauguration. The administration also faced backlash for removing posts about antisemitism from the mayor's official social media account.

<h4><b>3. JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
  Israel's Construction and Housing Ministry has issued a tender for 3,401 housing units in the controversial E1 area east of Jerusalem, a move that critics argue would effectively bisect the West Bank. This advancement comes alongside a new UN report claiming conditions in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have "drastically deteriorated" and urging Israel to end policies described as "racial segregation." Israel's mission in Geneva denounced the UN findings as politically driven and a "moral and institutional failure."

  A growing number of Israelis are relocating to Costa Rica to escape the stress and "warlike" atmosphere of daily life in Israel. This migration has led to the establishment of communities featuring synagogues, Shabbat dinners, and Hebrew signage in the jungle, such as surfboards repurposed as menus with "Shalom" written on them. One new resident summarized the sentiment by noting, "The farther you are from Israel, the closer you want to be to it."

  The Trump administration is signaling plans to maintain control over Venezuela’s oil industry for years following the military extraction of Nicolás Maduro. While Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has been installed as an interim leader to manage daily governance under U.S. pressure, there is no immediate timeline for new elections. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced that the U.S. will sell Venezuelan production indefinitely, though experts warn that revitalizing the sector requires massive capital investment that private firms may be hesitant to provide.

  Tensions between the U.S. and Colombia appeared to de-escalate following an hour-long phone call between President Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Just hours after Petro expressed fear of being seized like Maduro, Trump described the conversation as "excellent" and indicated a willingness to meet in the future. This diplomatic pivot comes amidst broader regional uncertainty following the U.S. operation in Venezuela.

  Protests have erupted across Iran in response to rapid currency inflation, with reports of clashes between security forces and demonstrators resulting in casualties on both sides. The Iranian regime has responded with lethal force, reportedly killing 38 people since the unrest began. Amidst the turmoil, Iranian authorities also executed Ali Ardestani, who was convicted in a closed-door trial of spying for Israel.

  The <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> announced it will cease publication in May after 240 years, leaving a metro area of 1.2 million without a dedicated daily newspaper. The decision follows a lengthy labor dispute and a Supreme Court refusal to block a lower court order requiring the owners to adhere to a 2014 union contract. Ownership cited financial losses of over $350 million as a primary driver for the closure.

  Linguist John McWhorter argues that the Trump administration’s use of the acronym "FAFO" (involving the F-word) regarding Venezuela signals a linguistic maturity in American English. He notes that the F-word was historically ordinary before becoming stigmatized in the 1500s, and its re-emergence in high-level discourse reflects a loosening of puritanical boundaries about the body. While McWhorter finds the specific application to a lethal military operation "revoltingly jocular," he views the normalization of the word itself as a positive evolution.

<h4><b>6. HIGHER EDUCATION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
  Texas A&M University has banned an excerpt from Plato's <em>Symposium</em> from a philosophy course, a move that surprised the professor who had already removed units on race and gender ideology to comply with new restrictions. The specific exclusion of a foundational Western text suggests that current educational censorship efforts may be expanding beyond contemporary political hot-button issues. This incident highlights the growing tension between academic freedom and legislative mandates in state-funded institutions.

  Congress has signaled it will reject the Trump administration's proposals to slash scientific research funding, instead moving to keep funding steady for key agencies. This legislative pushback effectively preserves the budgets for three major research bodies against White House efforts to reduce them. The move provides temporary relief to the research community, which had feared significant cuts to federal grants and scientific programs.

  The Supreme Court will consider taking up <em>Monsanto Company v.

Monsanto argues that federal EPA regulations, which did not require such warnings, should preempt state liability claims.

<h4><b>8. OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
  David French argues that President Trump’s intervention in Venezuela represents a dangerous return to a 19th-century "might makes right" view of warfare, abandoning the post-WWII "just war" framework established to prevent global conflict. French contends that treating war merely as an extension of policy, rather than a moral last resort, incentivizes weaker nations to form alliances with American adversaries and seek nuclear proliferation. He warns that while "America First" offers a short-term sugar high of national power, it ultimately destroys the international order that depends on American restraint.

  Jonathan V. Last contrasts the right-wing reaction to the killing of Ashli Babbitt with the recent killing of Renee Good by ICE, arguing this discrepancy reveals a fascist worldview where law enforcement is viewed as a tool for dominating enemies rather than a neutral institution. He posits that for this movement, violence committed by the "in-group" (Babbitt) is justified, while violence against the "out-group" (Good) is also justified by the state. Last concludes that this isn't simple hypocrisy, but a coherent illiberal ideology that requires a dedicated legal response.

  Matthew Yglesias argues that Democrats should adopt a "center-left" approach to fossil fuels similar to Norway or Canada, investing in reducing consumption through technology rather than trying to stifle domestic production. He contends that restricting U.S. supply doesn't reduce global burning of fossil fuels but does harm American economic and security interests. Yglesias pushes back against critics by asserting that energy pragmatism is essential for winning elections in key states like Pennsylvania and Texas.
