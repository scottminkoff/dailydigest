    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A public feud between former President Donald Trump and one of his staunchest congressional allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), has escalated over her push for the full release of the Justice Department's files on Jeffrey Epstein. In a CNN interview, Greene said Trump's comments have been "hurtful," particularly his calling her a "traitor," which she claimed puts her life in danger. Trump responded on Truth Social, calling Greene a "ranting lunatic" and a RINO, and signaled support for a primary challenger against her. Greene hit back on X, suggesting Trump's attack was meant to scare other Republicans ahead of a planned House vote on the Epstein files.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on legislation from Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) that would force the full release of the Epstein records. Massie predicted a "deluge" of Republican support, warning colleagues that the vote's record "will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency." The issue has gained new prominence after Trump demanded the DOJ investigate prominent Democrats' ties to Epstein. Attorney General Pam Bondi has assigned Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to lead the probe. Newly released documents also show Epstein exchanged texts with Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.) during a congressional hearing on Michael Cohen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has transformed the Department of Homeland Security to focus on a large-scale deportation campaign, which a New York Times investigation found has diverted resources from efforts to combat child predators and sex trafficking. This past weekend, masked Border Patrol agents began an operation dubbed "Charlotte's Web" in Charlotte, N.C., arresting people in encounters that triggered protests. The next target city is reportedly New Orleans, in an operation called "Catahoula Crunch." In New York, federal use of county jails for immigrant detention has surged this year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the wake of the recent government shutdown, funding for the SNAP program has resumed, and the Department of Transportation has eased flight restrictions at 40 major airports due to improved air traffic controller staffing. However, a CBS poll found that Americans believe Republicans won the shutdown by a margin of 55 percent to 6 percent. Congress now faces debates over expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, with some moderate House Republicans pushing for a deal to avoid premium hikes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Vice President JD Vance has remained quiet amid a controversy involving Tucker Carlson's friendly interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. The interview prompted an internal uproar at the Heritage Foundation after its president, Kevin Roberts, defended Carlson. Fuentes has interpreted Vance's silence as a victory. In a recent Fox News interview, Vance claimed, without evidence, that "30 million illegal immigrants" were taking houses that "ought by right go to American citizens."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Additional political updates include Trump pardoning two more individuals for crimes related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection; the administration expanding the foreign terrorist list to include left-wing European groups and Latin American drug cartels; and newly released disclosures showing that former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise departure in August came amid an ethics investigation into her trading of individual stocks.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The race to become the next New York City Council speaker is intensifying, with Brooklyn's 17-member delegation attempting to unify as an influential voting bloc. According to City & State, Queens Democratic Party leader Rep. Greg Meeks has praised Council Member Julie Menin, a moderate, while progressives are seen as favoring Council Member Crystal Hudson. Council Member Amanda Farías is viewed as a potential compromise candidate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants, a move that would expand federal detention capacity in the city. This comes as the administration seeks to escalate immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities. In a related development, a federal judge threw out a lawsuit the Trump administration had filed against the city of Rochester over its sanctuary city policy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Queens, a judge has ordered a temporary halt to a new agreement over the use of Citi Field’s parking lot, a decision that could torpedo Mets owner Steve Cohen's bid to build a casino on the site. Meanwhile, funding for SNAP benefits has resumed for the nearly 3 million New Yorkers who rely on it, ending what officials called a "nail-biting scramble" during the government shutdown.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">At the state level, conservationists are again pressing Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign a ban on the harvesting of horseshoe crabs, a year after she vetoed a similar measure. In Brooklyn, elected officials are warning that the Brooklyn Hospital Center could be forced to shut down by the end of the year if it does not receive financial assistance from the state.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and halt to global assistance programs has had a devastating human toll, according to writer and surgeon Dr. Atul Gawande. In an interview with The Bulwark, Gawande, who oversaw USAID's global health programs in the Biden administration, discussed his new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," which follows a Sudanese refugee in Kenya whose daughter suffers from severe malnutrition due to aid cuts. Infectious disease modelers estimate that 600,000 people, including 400,000 children, may have already died as a result of the cuts, which Gawande called an "assault on the idea of cooperation to solve big problems."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump Organization is in talks to bring a Trump-branded property to a major Saudi Arabian government-owned real estate development. The New York Times reports that the potential deal comes as President Trump is set to host Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Washington next week. The prince is overseeing the $63 billion project to transform the historic town of Diriyah into a luxury destination.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump told reporters he has "sort of" decided how to proceed regarding Venezuela but did not offer details. His comments followed several high-level meetings where officials discussed possible military operations in the country. A classified DOJ brief reportedly describes fentanyl as a potential chemical weapons threat justifying intervention.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other international news, women in India are suffering significant health and economic consequences from long-term heat exposure. In Syria, families of rebels who were seized under Bashar al-Assad's regime are beginning to speak about their trauma. And at the BBC, a controversy over the editing of a speech by President Trump has escalated into a major crisis, with Trump now threatening a $5 billion lawsuit against the broadcaster.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">After nearly three decades, the cable channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW this weekend. According to Politico, the name change, part of a reported $20 million effort, was prompted by its parent company, Versant, spinning out from NBC Universal. The acronym stands for "My Source for News, Opinion and the World." The relaunch comes as the channel faces a 34 percent decline in its total audience this year amid a fragmenting media landscape.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A growing number of people are turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, reports The New York Times. A survey found that one in six adults consults an AI bot for medical information. While many users find the bots to be empathetic and accessible, doctors express concern about the potential for chatbots to provide incomplete or fabricated answers for high-stakes health decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a genetic breakthrough, scientists have sequenced RNA from a 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth, by far the oldest on record. The study, published in the journal Cell, pushed the timeline for RNA survival back by 25,000 years. The research also revealed a surprise about the famous mammoth mummy, named Yuka: genetic analysis of its Y chromosome showed it was male, not female as previously believed for years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, the U.S. penny was officially discontinued this week after 232 years in circulation. And in San Francisco, the expansion of driverless taxis faced a setback after one of the vehicles killed a beloved cat, prompting new safety questions.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn interviews Dr. Atul Gawande about the human toll of the Trump administration's decision to dismantle USAID and halt foreign aid. Cohn frames the policy as possibly "the cruelest, most senseless thing Trump has done," detailing how the cuts have led to a resurgence of severe malnutrition and preventable deaths, particularly among children. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times editorial board argues that while Democrats view House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as a unifying figure, he is "too smooth, too reasonable, too benign to cut a compelling opposition figure in the Trump era" and that the party needs a "wartime consigliere" to meet the current political moment. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/opinion/hakeem-jeffries-democrats.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Dispatch's G-File newsletter, Jonah Goldberg argues that various factions on the right—including postliberals, nationalists, and integralists—helped create the conditions for the rise of white nationalist Nick Fuentes and his "groyper" movement, even if they now disavow him. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/postliberalism-nick-fuentes-donald-trump/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Also in The New York Times, Jean Twenge writes that to improve test scores, schools should ban not just smartphones but also laptops and tablets, as they are equally distracting. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/schools-laptops-tablets-test-scores.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/opinion/schools-laptops-tablets-test-scores.html</a></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his newsletter for The New York Times, Jamelle Bouie contends that following the government shutdown, too many Democrats have an instinct to "retreat to normalcy rather than face the conflict at hand," and that they must be willing to use power to fortify the political system against authoritarianism. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/democrats-shutdown-trump.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/opinion/democrats-shutdown-trump.html</a></p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally cut federal funding or fine the University of California system over claims of antisemitism and discrimination. The ruling blocks a key tactic the administration has used to pressure universities.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In New York, the State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees took the unusual step of formally voting down the nomination of Maria Conzatti to become the permanent president of Nassau Community College. The move escalates a leadership fight at the college that has lasted for more than three years.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, longtime editor Tina Brown discussed the current media landscape, expressing disappointment in Jeff Bezos's stewardship of The Washington Post and bemusement at Tucker Carlson's transformation from a talented writer to a "frothing lunatic."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new book by journalist Olivia Nuzzi details the digital affair she had with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that upended her career. She writes about how the infatuation consumed her and the professional fallout that ensued.</p>
