    <div class="content"><h4>November 22, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump’s push to redraw congressional districts to favor Republicans is facing significant legal and political setbacks. A federal court blocked a new map in Texas that would have benefited the GOP, ruling it violated the Voting Rights Act; the state has appealed to the Supreme Court. Republican-led redistricting efforts have also stalled or been struck down in Utah, Ohio, Kansas, and Indiana, potentially leaving Democrats with a slight advantage in the redistricting battle ahead of the 2026 midterms. In Indiana, Senate GOP leader Rodric Bray has resisted White House pressure to redraw maps, citing the need to preserve trust in the institution.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On the immigration front, the Supreme Court is privately weighing whether to hear arguments on President Trump’s challenge to birthright citizenship. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is intensifying enforcement operations. Customs and Border Protection agents recently conducted arrests in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a similar operation is expected to begin in New Orleans. However, reports indicate confusion among local officials regarding these operations, and the Department of Homeland Security has stopped publishing detailed monthly enforcement data. A federal judge ruled that President Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., illegally superseded city authority, though the ruling is temporarily on hold. Additionally, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she intends to resign from Congress in January.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other federal news, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated he personally instructed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism. The House Oversight Committee was informed that Ghislaine Maxwell will invoke her Fifth Amendment rights regarding an inquiry into the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled specifications for a new, advanced female crash test dummy to better represent female anatomy in safety testing. Finally, the Coast Guard reversed course on a reported plan to stop classifying swastikas and nooses as hate symbols, reiterating that such displays are forbidden.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met with President Donald Trump at the White House, a meeting described by both parties as productive despite their ideological differences. Trump praised Mamdani, predicting he would do a "very good job," and explicitly rejected Representative Elise Stefanik’s characterization of Mamdani as a "jihadist." The two found common ground on the need to lower energy costs and increase housing supply to improve affordability. Following the meeting, Mamdani’s team indicated a willingness to work with the administration where interests align, particularly regarding the city's affordability crisis.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In state political news, Representative Nydia Velázquez announced she will retire after 16 terms in Congress, opening up a competitive primary for her seat. Separately, New York’s ethics agency closed its investigation into former state Senator Jeff Klein regarding allegations of forcible kissing, despite a majority vote acknowledging sufficient evidence; no penalties will be imposed. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reversed a decision to cancel naturalization ceremonies in upstate New York following bipartisan backlash.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Regarding legal and criminal justice matters, federal prosecutors defended their decision to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, accused of assassinating the UnitedHealthcare CEO. In a separate case, Christopher G. Baldner, a state trooper tried for murder in connection with a vehicle pursuit, was found not guilty. Additionally, Edwin Ramos died in custody on Rikers Island just hours before he was expected to plead guilty and be released. Finally, the operator of New York’s energy grid warned that the system is at an "inflection point," with aging fossil fuel plants retiring amid surging demand.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Israeli settlers launched attacks on Palestinians in several West Bank villages overnight, reportedly setting fires to vehicles and wounding residents. The incidents drew condemnation from Israeli President Isaac Herzog and IDF officials. Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz stated that the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is currently holding.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested relations with the United States may be at a breaking point as the White House presses Kyiv to accept a new peace plan. The proposal, devised by U.S. and Russian negotiators, would reportedly require Ukraine to cede territory and shrink its military in exchange for security guarantees. Zelensky has been given a deadline of next Thursday to agree to the terms. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are coordinating closely with Zelensky regarding the proposal.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other international news, a public inquiry in the U.K. concluded the government's early response to the COVID-19 pandemic was "too little, too late," leading to thousands of avoidable deaths. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to approve a new Chinese embassy in London despite espionage concerns. In Nigeria, separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu was convicted of terrorism charges and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Department of Energy finalized a $1 billion loan to help restart the Three Mile Island nuclear facility, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, to power Microsoft data centers; this move signals a broader potential resurgence for nuclear power driven by AI energy demands. In the pharmaceutical sector, Eli Lilly became the first healthcare company to reach a $1 trillion valuation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In entertainment, the film adaptation of "Wicked" has been released, featuring new songs. A new documentary was screened for House members alleging the U.S. government is concealing knowledge of U.F.O.s. Netflix has opened its first permanent location near Philadelphia featuring immersive exhibits. Additionally, a Harvard researcher identified Johann Sebastian Bach as the composer of two previously unsigned works found in a Belgian library.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Montclair State University is facing faculty pushback over a plan to reorganize 15 departments into four schools, with administrators arguing it will foster interdisciplinarity while faculty worry about the role of departments. At the University of Virginia, a presidential search is complicated by political turmoil following a "tell-all" by current President Jim Ryan, raising questions about the next leader's stance on diversity, equity, and DEI efforts. Furthermore, the American Musicological Society is facing a revolt from members threatening a boycott unless specific demands are met.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Errol Louis writes in <i>New York Magazine</i> that critics of NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani fear not his failure, but the possibility that he might succeed. In <i>The New York Times</i>, Mara Gay argues that President Trump’s effusive response to Mamdani illustrates the Mayor-elect's sharp political instincts and ability to charm rivals. Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark argues in the <i>New York Daily News</i> that "Raise the Age" legislation can succeed with better funding and coordination. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial board contends that the hemp industry is a free-market success that Congress has effectively killed. Finally, David Brooks writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that the obsession with Jeffrey Epstein is fueled by a "QAnon mentality," a stance criticized by <i>The Racket</i> as dismissing genuine concerns about elite corruption.</p>
