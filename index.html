        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has signed a legislative package to fund the federal government, ending a partial shutdown just hours after the House narrowly passed the measure. The deal temporarily funds the Department of Homeland Security but sets up a new deadline in less than two weeks, with Democrats digging in on demands for immigration enforcement reforms. House Speaker Mike Johnson faced significant internal opposition, requiring assistance from the White House to flip votes from the Freedom Caucus.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding their alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein, reversing their previous resistance to subpoenas. The couple faced an ultimatum from Speaker Mike Johnson, who threatened to move forward with contempt of Congress votes if they did not agree to the standard terms of transcribed, filmed depositions. Committee Chair James Comer stated that the pair "completely caved," with Hillary Clinton scheduled to appear on February 26 and Bill Clinton on February 27.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump is considering Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve board member, as his pick for the next Fed chair, a choice that signals a balance between establishment credentials and loyalty. While Warsh has a history of defending Fed independence, the administration hopes he will be amenable to lower interest rates, though experts warn he would still need to secure votes from other board members to enact such policy. Warsh previously described central bank independence as vital, once stating that political influence on Fed policy would yield a "strong and forceful rebuke."</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado has reportedly selected former Buffalo mayoral candidate India Walton as his running mate in his primary challenge against Governor Kathy Hochul. The selection of Walton, a democratic socialist, is seen as a strategic move to shore up support from the party's left flank and the Working Families Party. Walton had previously expressed skepticism about Delgado, once posting on Instagram, "Who the hell is Antione Delmonico?"</p>

Hochul also announced she has finalized her choice for a new running mate to replace Delgado on her ticket, stating, "There has only been one offer made, and one person accepted."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani is facing pushback over his plans to phase out the city's gifted and talented program for kindergarteners starting next year. Critics argue this move, similar to efforts by former Mayor de Blasio, prioritizes ideological "anti-racism" over academic excellence and what parents actually want. The article contends that ending the program would "do the most harm to those who are cited most often as deserving of help."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York and New Jersey have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for withholding billions of dollars in federal funding for the Gateway Project’s Hudson River tunnel. The lawsuit seeks to force the administration to release the funds, arguing that the delay threatens a project critical to the region's economy and infrastructure. Officials warn that without the funds, hundreds of workers could be thrown off the job this week.</p>

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Chinese President Xi Jinping has initiated a massive military purge, removing senior General Zhang Youxia on corruption charges that allegedly include leaking nuclear secrets to the U.S. This move consolidates Xi’s control over the People's Liberation Army and removes potential rivals, leaving the Central Military Commission with only Xi and his disciplinary chief. Analysts suggest this crackdown aims to professionalize the military but also creates uncertainty regarding future leadership succession.</p>

Despite these tensions, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had earlier expressed support for "fair and equitable negotiations."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York Times journalists are currently on an expedition in Antarctica to study the Thwaites Glacier, a massive ice formation whose melting could disastrously raise global sea levels. The team faced a setback when key instruments froze while being lowered into the glacier, but they continue to map ice rifts using radar-equipped helicopters. The mission underscores the high stakes of climate research in one of the world's most remote and hostile environments.</p>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Matthew Yglesias argues that President Trump's desire to drive housing prices up to protect incumbent homeowners is economically misguided and harms long-term growth. He posits that restricting the supply of housing to boost asset values creates a "degrowth spiral" that makes society poorer in practical terms, similar to banning new cars to boost used car values. Yglesias concludes that broad upzoning is a pro-growth policy that would ultimately make Americans better off, despite the loss-aversion of current homeowners.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ross Douthat explores the "triumph of vice" in America—from gambling to marijuana—as a symptom of a crisis in liberalism that treats citizens as atomized individuals. He argues that while post-liberal critiques correctly identify the loss of a moral framework (often rooted in Protestantism), they fail to offer a viable political alternative that can command broad support. Douthat suggests that without a "softly institutionalized" moral vision, the liberal order risks devolving into addiction and despair.</p>
