President Trump is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today at Mar-a-Lago to discuss a 20-point peace plan designed to end the war. While Zelenskyy has signaled openness to compromises, significant differences regarding territorial concessions remain as Kyiv seeks security guarantees. Trump told reporters he believes the meeting is "going to go good," though he emphasized that no deal exists until he approves it.

Utah Republicans are launching a ballot initiative to repeal an anti-gerrymandering measure, aiming to allow the legislature to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2028 cycle. This move follows a court ruling that selected a map creating a safe Democratic seat, prompting the GOP to seek a repeal that would grant them control over the process for potentially four redraws in eight years. A committee funded by national GOP groups is currently gathering signatures for the repeal effort under a tight Valentine's Day deadline.

The Department of Homeland Security has arrested over 595,000 unauthorized immigrants since January, with deportations reaching 600,000 this year, though critics note this falls short of the administration's 1 million benchmark. An analysis of enforcement operations, including a 64-day blitz in Chicago, indicates a strategic shift toward arresting immigrants in local communities rather than just jails, with many detainees having no criminal convictions. Conservative allies argue the trajectory is insufficient to be called a "mass deportation," while civil rights advocates warn of spreading fear.

Warwick Mayor Michael Newhard has issued a warning to Ulster Town Board officials regarding the fire risks associated with lithium-ion battery storage facilities following a recent incident. Newhard cautioned that developers often fail to keep safety promises, highlighting concerns after a second fire occurred at a relatively small battery energy storage system. The warning comes as municipalities across the Hudson Valley grapple with regulating green energy infrastructure.

The UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency session regarding Israel's recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland, a move not matched by any other nation. Reports indicate that Israel and the U.S. have discussed using Somaliland and other East African territories to potentially resettle Palestinians from Gaza. This diplomatic maneuver has sparked immediate international backlash and urgent diplomatic consultations.

Italian authorities have arrested nine individuals suspected of funneling approximately 7 million euros to Hamas through charitable organizations. Prosecutors identified Mohammad Hannoun, president of the Palestinian Association in Italy, as the alleged head of the local Hamas cell. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi stated the operation revealed how initiatives pretending to aid the Palestinian population were "concealed support for and participation in terrorist organizations."

Eli Feldstein, a former spokesman for Prime Minister Netanyahu, told investigators that a senior official in the Prime Minister's Office offered to "silence" an IDF investigation into classified leaks. Feldstein identified the official as Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman, claiming Netanyahu was aware of and supported the leak strategy. Despite these admissions regarding the "Qatargate" and "BibiLeaks" affairs, Feldstein has reportedly not been questioned further on these specific allegations.

Fifteen Australian Jews, including Holocaust survivors, were murdered on the first night of Hanukkah in a devastating attack that has shaken the diaspora community. The tragedy has intensified debates over how such violence is contextualized in media, with some arguing it is being used to manufacture consent for ongoing military actions. Hannah Einbinder writes that she mourns the victims as family, emphasizing the connection derived from "love—of our beautiful rituals, our community and culture."

The United States conducted airstrikes on suspected Islamic State targets in Nigeria, a move President Trump claimed was to protect Christians from persecution. However, experts warn the intervention steps into a complex conflict where Muslims are the primary victims of insurgent attacks in the Sokoto region. Nigerian officials are now bracing for potential retaliatory coordinated attacks following the U.S. military action.

French film icon and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has passed away at the age of 91. Known for her role in *And God Created Woman*, she retired from acting in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare, though her later years were marked by controversy over her political views. She remains a symbol of 1950s and 60s cinema and a complex figure in French cultural history.

New studies have seemingly settled a decades-long paleontological feud, confirming that *Nanotyrannus* was a distinct species of small tyrannosaur and not merely a juvenile *T. rex*. Analysis of a near-complete skeleton known as "Bloody Mary" provided the evidence needed to diagnose the dinosaur as a unique lineage that coexisted with its larger cousins. The findings suggest a higher diversity of predators at the end of the Cretaceous period than previously thought.

Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope believe they may have captured light from Population III stars, the very first stars to illuminate the universe over 13 billion years ago. The ancient galaxy LAP1-B showed expected low-metal signatures consistent with theoretical predictions for these primordial celestial bodies. Researchers suggest this observation may represent just the "tip of the iceberg" for studying the universe's origins via gravitational lensing.

For those planning New Year's Day brunch, experts recommend "make-ahead" dishes like French toast casserole or overnight oats to minimize morning labor. Preparing savory items like a crustless egg and cheese quiche the night before allows for a relaxing start to the new year. As one food editor noted, "The move here is to use croissants, whose flaky layers readily absorb the savory mix."

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir argued that anyone involved in the "Qatargate" affair should face lengthy prison sentences, though he defended Netanyahu as a "Zionist patriot." In a radio interview, he claimed to have previously warned the Prime Minister against employing spokesman Eli Feldstein, citing reliability issues. Ben-Gvir also controversially noted a police pilot program involving shooting at undocumented Palestinian workers.
