<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
President Trump and his administration have outlined a long-term plan for U.S. oversight of Venezuela following the military extraction of dictator Nicolás Maduro. In an interview with The New York Times, Trump suggested U.S. involvement could last for years, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a strategy focused on stability and economic recovery funded by Venezuelan oil sales. Energy Secretary Chris Wright confirmed that the U.S. intends to sell this oil "indefinitely" into the marketplace to generate revenue for the Venezuelan people.

Tensions have escalated in Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent during a residential traffic stop. While Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem labeled Good a "domestic terrorist," local officials and witnesses dispute the claim, and DHS insiders have privately expressed shock at the administration's rush to judgment before an investigation. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has issued a warning order to prepare the state National Guard, stating that Minnesota "doesn’t need any further help from the federal government."

The Trump administration has released new dietary guidelines that invert the traditional food pyramid, prioritizing proteins and fats like steak and butter while discouraging processed foods. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated his message is simply to "eat real food," marking a significant departure from decades of federal nutritional advice. The new guidelines also loosened recommendations on alcohol consumption, removing specific daily drink limits in favor of a general suggestion to limit intake.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s first week in office has been turbulent, facing backlash from staff over revoked executive orders and controversial social media posts by his new appointee, Cea Weaver. Weaver, appointed to head the Office to Protect Tenant Rights, is under fire for past posts calling private property a "weapon of white supremacy." Mamdani defended Weaver while also managing tensions with Jewish staffers concerned about the disappearance of posts condemning antisemitism from the mayor's official X account.

Israel’s Construction and Housing Ministry has issued a tender for 3,401 housing units in the E1 area east of Jerusalem, a controversial move that critics argue could bisect the West Bank and impede a future two-state solution. This development coincides with a new UN report claiming conditions in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have "drastically deteriorated" regarding racial segregation. Prime Minister Netanyahu also commented on regional security, calling Lebanon's efforts to disarm Hezbollah "encouraging but far from sufficient."

A growing number of Israelis are relocating to Costa Rica to escape the intense, warlike atmosphere of daily life in Israel, building a community complete with synagogues and Hebrew signage. These expatriates describe the move not as a political statement or rejection of Zionism, but as a necessary mental health break from the stress of their homeland. One new resident summarized the sentiment by noting, "The farther you are from Israel, the closer you want to be to it."

Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has assumed the role of acting president following the U.S. military operation that removed Nicolás Maduro. While the Trump administration has signaled willingness to work with Rodríguez if she complies with demands to expel hostile foreign operatives, the path to democratic elections remains unclear. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a three-step plan involving stability and economic recovery, but noted it is "far too premature" to discuss immediate elections.

Congress has effectively rejected the Trump administration's attempt to slash funding for scientific research, indicating they will keep funding steady for key agencies. Legislators pushed back against White House efforts to cut appropriations for the NSF, NIH, and other research bodies. This legislative resistance ensures that federal support for scientific research remains stable despite executive pressure.

The Supreme Court is set to consider a petition involving Monsanto and Roundup weedkiller that could determine whether the company can be held liable under state laws for failing to warn about cancer risks. Monsanto argues that federal EPA regulations, which did not require such a warning, should preempt state liability claims.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
David French argues that President Trump's unilateral strike on Venezuela represents a return to a 19th-century "might makes right" foreign policy, abandoning the "just-war theory" that has guided the post-WWII order. He contends that treating war as a mere extension of policy, rather than a last resort governed by international law, invites global instability and nuclear proliferation. French warns, "The true international norm is that when the strong dominate the weak, the weak try to become strong."

He pushes back against critics who dismiss policy arguments based solely on funding sources rather than the merits of the ideas.

He contrasts the government's demonization of the victim, Renee Good, with the praise previously heaped upon Ashli Babbitt by the same political faction. Last writes, "The illiberal view—the fascist view—is that violence is a tool for domination of the out-group."
