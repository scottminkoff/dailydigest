    <div class="content"><h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Donald Trump made a sudden reversal Sunday evening, stating on Truth Social that House Republicans should vote to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The announcement comes just two days before a scheduled vote on a bipartisan effort led by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), which the White House and GOP leadership had fought for months to block. The shift in position is seen as a significant victory for Massie, as dozens of Republicans were expected to defy the president. Trump, who also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate potential links between Epstein and several prominent Democrats, framed his change of heart as an effort to get Republicans to refocus on other issues, stating, "we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax." In the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune is now considering options for a vote.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is attempting to shift focus to the economy and affordability, issues that polling from the American Communities Project and Ipsos shows are top concerns for voters across the country. President Trump lifted tariffs on a range of imported food products, including coffee, beef, and bananas, in an effort to lower grocery prices. However, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pushed back against the narrative that prices are rising, claiming purchasing power has increased. The affordability push has been overshadowed by internal party conflicts. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has been feuding with Trump over the Epstein files, said on CNN that the president calling her a "traitor" was "hurtful" and could put her life in danger. She also claimed her family was targeted by "hoax pizza deliveries" and a pipe bomb threat, which Trump said he did not believe.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In another intra-party conflict, President Trump is moving against Indiana Republicans who opposed his state redistricting efforts. He plans to endorse a primary challenger to state Sen. Jim Buck and has invited GOP holdouts to one-on-one meetings at the White House. One state senator who opposed the plan, Greg Goode, was targeted in a "swatting" incident at his home. Gov. Mike Braun affirmed his support for Trump on the issue.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal magistrate judge ruled that "government misconduct," including "fundamental misstatements of the law" by lead prosecutor Lindsey Halligan, may have imperiled the Justice Department’s criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey. The judge ordered prosecutors to turn over grand jury records to Comey's defense team. Separately, the Justice Department is facing a lawsuit filed by Maurene Comey, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Albany will handle the government's defense.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Department of Homeland Security has reportedly diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants. A New York Times investigation found this shift has undermined a wide range of law enforcement operations, including probes into child exploitation, sex trafficking, and the black market for Iranian oil. The immigration crackdown has expanded to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Border Patrol agents began operations over the weekend. The next target is reportedly New Orleans.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, the Supreme Court has agreed to rule on the legality of "metering," a policy that controls the number of asylum seekers at U.S.-Mexico border crossings. The Federal Aviation Administration has lifted all flight restrictions imposed during the government shutdown. And President Trump has pardoned two more people for crimes connected to the January 6 Capitol insurrection.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Kathy Hochul is preparing for a series of political battles as she navigates an ideological divide with New York City’s newly elected democratic socialist mayor, Zohran Mamdani, and contends with potential federal funding cuts from the Trump administration. The governor and mayor-elect met last week to discuss legislative priorities. One of the first tests of the relationship between Mamdani and Washington will be whether the Trump administration grants him the top-level security clearance required for the job, given the president's history of revoking clearances for political opponents.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A central point of contention will be Mamdani's fiscal agenda. Supporters rallied in Manhattan, calling on Hochul to back his plan to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund initiatives like universal child care. State Sen. Jabari Brisport warned the governor that if she blocks the funding, "you're out." Incoming Partnership for New York City head Steven Fulop called the proposed corporate tax hikes "absolute suicide." In response to the pressure, Gov. Hochul is reportedly considering some form of non-income tax increase. Meanwhile, State Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have introduced the Fair Share Act, which would raise taxes on millionaires in NYC.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor-elect Mamdani is beginning to shape his administration, stating he is confident in his plan to retain Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner, though the appointment is not yet official. According to The New York Times, police officers hold opinions ranging from uneasiness to open-mindedness about the incoming administration. Mamdani is also facing early friction with some progressive allies; his reported plan to back former Comptroller Brad Lander in a primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman has irked the NYC-DSA, which has endorsed City Council Member Alexa Avilés for the seat.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In state news, New York has agreed to delay the implementation of its all-electric buildings law as a court case proceeds. Gov. Hochul is also calling on the federal government to release heat assistance funds, which remain uncertain after the shutdown. In Albany, legislation that would end a subsidy for new natural gas hookups was the most-lobbied bill over the summer, according to preliminary data.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In New York City politics, the race for City Council speaker is heating up with candidates participating in public forums. The 17-member Brooklyn delegation, led by party leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, is attempting to unite as a voting bloc to increase its influence. Separately, a judge has temporarily halted a new agreement over the use of Citi Field's parking lot, which could jeopardize the Mets owners' bid to build a casino.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York is also grappling with the rise of artificial intelligence. Gov. Hochul has until late December to sign or veto the RAISE Act, which would regulate major AI models. The tech industry is pushing for changes to the bill, and a new pro-AI super PAC has announced it will spend millions to oppose the campaign of the bill's sponsor, Assemblymember Alex Bores, who is running for Congress.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his final international trip as mayor, Eric Adams is on a multi-day visit to Israel to show solidarity amid rising antisemitism. The trip, described as a "farewell visit," is likely to be the last of its kind by a New York City mayor for some time.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to establish its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, opting against a traditional state commission of inquiry. Critics are concerned this approach may lack independence. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution concerning Gaza that leaves open the possibility of Palestinian statehood, a concept Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to publicly oppose.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In California, a new "antisemitism prevention" law is being criticized as part of a broader campaign against ethnic studies curricula. According to an analysis in Jewish Currents, the law may ironically make it more difficult to engage with the evolving conditions of Jewish identity.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">From Gaza, a memoiristic essay by Abdullah Hany Daher describes a society where schools, libraries, and books have nearly vanished after two years of conflict, though children continue to find ways to learn.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United Kingdom's political landscape is fracturing as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government faces turmoil, with his approval rating plummeting to -48%. According to The Dispatch, widespread disillusionment with both the Labour and Conservative parties, fueled by economic stagnation and anger over immigration, has propelled the right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, to 29% in the polls. This surge threatens Britain's traditional two-party system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is working to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia and has announced major changes to "reboot" the country's energy sector following corruption scandals. His efforts come as European leaders express concern over corruption in Ukraine. In the ongoing conflict, Russia launched new strikes on Kharkiv and Kyiv, while Ukraine continued to target Russian energy infrastructure.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In South America, Chile's presidential election is headed to a December runoff between Communist Party member Jeannette Jara and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast. Kast is considered the early favorite. President Trump stated he may hold discussions with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as the U.S. increases its military presence in the Caribbean. Elsewhere, a Colombian government airstrike targeting a rebel group killed at least seven children, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a peace deal with the M23 rebel group.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On the trade front, the U.S. and Switzerland have reached a deal to cut tariffs on Swiss imports, with Swiss companies pledging $200 billion in American investments. However, European Union officials are warning Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick against expanding tariffs on other European products, arguing it would undermine a recent trade agreement.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Patients are increasingly turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical information, citing long wait times, inattentive doctors, and high costs in the traditional healthcare system. According to The New York Times, many users find the bots to be more empathetic and accessible. While some doctors see potential benefits, such as patients arriving at appointments better informed, there are significant concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated medical advice, as chatbots have been known to provide incomplete or fabricated answers.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In San Francisco, the expansion of driverless taxis faced a setback after one of the vehicles killed a beloved cat, highlighting public concerns as autonomous technology becomes more widespread.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ken Burns' new documentary on the American Revolution debuted on PBS, with reviewers noting its urgent and relevant treatment of slavery and the nation's founding. Another historical drama, Netflix's "Death by Lightning," about the assassination of President James Garfield, is also drawing attention for its parallels to the current political moment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In corporate news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly plans to resign as early as 2026.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data indicates that the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges began before the Trump administration, with a 7 percent drop last fall. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the decrease was primarily driven by waning interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures for this year suggest the trend may worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining or cutting funding to the University of California system. The administration had threatened the penalties over alleged discrimination and concerns of antisemitic civil rights violations on its campuses.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Florida, an instructor at a public university claims that "secret rules" are now governing what can be taught. In a piece for The Chronicle of Higher Education, the instructor stated they were required to change course materials without any specific law backing the demand, reflecting ongoing curriculum crackdowns in the state.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who has led the company since 2014, announced he plans to retire early next year.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Bulwark, Jonathan Cohn interviews surgeon and former Biden administration official Atul Gawande, who argues that the Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is a "public man-made death now at large scale." Gawande discusses his new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," which details the human toll of cutting global assistance, particularly for malnutrition programs that he says have saved millions of lives. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless-thing-trump-has-done</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias contends that the group of Democratic senators who ended the government shutdown should not be labeled "moderates." He argues they were acting as "earnest progressive Democrats" prioritizing concrete policy outcomes—like protecting federal workers and securing higher spending levels—over the political gains that could have been won by prolonging a shutdown that was damaging President Trump. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation</a></p>
