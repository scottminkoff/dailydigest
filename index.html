    <div class="content"><h4>November 26, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: A federal judge dismissed the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, concluding that the interim U.S. Attorney appointed by the Trump administration to bring the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was not legally appointed. The Justice Department is likely to appeal the ruling, but the statute of limitations on the charges against Comey has expired.</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark: The White House floated a proposal for a two-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies but pulled the plan after immediate backlash from congressional Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson informed the administration that House Republicans "don't have an appetite" for an extension, with conservatives wanting more dramatic changes to the law, including new abortion-related restrictions, before considering a deal.</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO Playbook: The FBI is requesting interviews with six Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Mark Kelly, after they appeared in a video urging U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders. The move has drawn criticism from the lawmakers, who accuse the President of weaponizing the government, and from some Republicans, like Rep. Don Bacon, who called the threat of sedition charges "crazy." The Pentagon has also opened an investigation into Kelly for "serious allegations of misconduct" related to the video.</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Atlantic: The Trump administration has increasingly deployed Border Patrol agents for immigration raids in major cities, a shift from relying solely on ICE. The two agencies operate with different tactics; while ICE veterans practice "targeted enforcement" by building lists of individuals to arrest, Border Patrol's paramilitary-style culture favors "area control," a more indiscriminate approach that involves swarming locations and has resulted in the mistaken arrest of U.S. citizens.</p>

In Arizona, Republican lawmakers have pre-filed a proposed ballot measure to abolish the state's permanent mail voter list and add new restrictions to mail-in voting.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: An analysis of President Trump's schedule reveals that at age 79, he has fewer public events and travels domestically less than during his first year in office. Most of his public appearances now occur between noon and 5 p.m. The White House pushed back on any suggestion of fatigue, stating the president's health remains "exceptional."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO New York Playbook: President Trump’s surprisingly friendly meeting with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has complicated Rep. Elise Stefanik's gubernatorial campaign. Stefanik had been building her campaign around tying Governor Kathy Hochul to Mamdani, whom Stefanik has called a "jihadist." When asked about the term, Trump declined to use it and praised the mayor-elect, forcing Stefanik to publicly "agree to disagree" with the president.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Capitol Confidential: Advocates are renewing their push for Governor Hochul to sign a bill creating a state Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate. The office would represent residential ratepayers in regulatory proceedings. Hochul vetoed a similar bill in 2021, citing redundancy, but supporters hope the current focus on affordability and rising energy costs will lead her to approve it this time.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: The number of restaurants participating in New York City's outdoor dining program has plummeted since the pandemic.
