        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A massive winter storm forming in the Rockies is expected to sweep across the Plains before hitting the East Coast this weekend, placing nearly half the U.S. population under weather alerts. The system threatens to bring heavy snow, ice, and freezing temperatures that could disrupt travel and power grids from Washington, D.C. to Boston. Meteorologists warn that Sunday is the day to "hunker down," with New York City potentially seeing its first significant snowfall in years and forecasts predicting up to 18 inches in some areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House passed a package of spending bills to fund several federal agencies, though funding for the Department of Homeland Security remains a major point of contention among Democrats. This legislative movement occurred as former special counsel Jack Smith testified before the House Judiciary Committee, accusing President Trump of undermining the rule of law regarding January 6. Smith faced intense grilling from Republicans, with Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan opening the hearing by stating, "We should never forget what took place, what they did to the guy 'We the People' elected president twice."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon, seeking at least $5 billion in damages. The suit alleges the bank discriminated against him by closing his accounts due to "political and social motivations" following the January 6 Capitol attacks. A bank spokesperson rejected the claim, stating accounts are closed only due to legal or regulatory risks, not political reasons.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A state Supreme Court justice has ordered the Independent Redistricting Commission to redraw New York’s 11th Congressional District, currently held by Republican Nicole Malliotakis. The ruling, which cites the disenfranchisement of Black and Latino voters, could upend the 2026 election cycle if the appellate process doesn't delay implementation beyond the petitioning period. Malliotakis called the ruling "ludicrous" and vowed to appeal, while the decision potentially opens the door for a challenge from Democrat Dan Goldman or others if the lines shift significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani is facing his first major logistical test as the city prepares for a potential foot of snow this weekend. The socialist mayor's handling of city services during the storm will be closely watched by critics and supporters alike as a measure of his administration's competency. Council Member Justin Sanchez noted, "This is the true test of the basics of the job... At the very essence, it’s city service delivery."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The state Public Service Commission approved rate hikes for Con Edison electricity and gas customers despite opposition from state lawmakers. The approval will increase bills over three years to generate over $1.1 billion for the utility, highlighting a growing rift between the legislature and Governor Hochul's administration over utility regulation. Commissioners argued the hike is necessary for reliability, while lawmakers slammed the decision as a "failure of responsibility" that forces residents to choose between heat and health care.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Kingston school board unanimously adopted a resolution pledging to stand up against what they describe as "President Donald Trump’s brutal immigration enforcement campaign." The resolution declares district grounds, buses, and events as "Safe Zones," establishing protocols to limit cooperation with non-local law enforcement. This move aligns the district against ICE operations as tensions rise over federal immigration policies.</p>

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump officially signed the charter for his "Board of Peace" initiative in Davos, which aims to oversee the demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu accepted an invitation to join, no Israeli representatives attended the launch, and major European powers like France and the UK have declined to participate due to concerns over the board's scope. Jared Kushner presented a "master plan" for a "New Gaza" featuring skyscrapers and a seaport, claiming reconstruction could be completed in two to three years.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ali Shaath, head of the technocratic committee set to administer Gaza, announced that the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Strip will reopen next week. Despite this announcement, an Israeli official stated the security cabinet still needs to discuss the matter, and reports indicate the U.S. is pressuring Israel to allow committee members entry into Gaza. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told broadcasters the crossing would open "very soon."</p>

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Details have emerged regarding a framework deal between the U.S., NATO, and Denmark concerning Greenland, following Trump's earlier threats of tariffs. The agreement reportedly designates parts of Greenland as "sovereign base areas" for the U.S. and boosts NATO's Arctic presence to counter Chinese mining interests. While Trump claimed he is getting "everything we want," Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen maintained that "we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty."</p>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Bob Bauer argues that Donald Trump's ability to make billions while in office represents a failure of conflict-of-interest norms that previously constrained presidents. He suggests that because Trump has successfully branded his wealth accumulation as a sign of business prowess, he has insulated himself from political scandal. Bauer warns that without reform, this "politics of self-enrichment" erodes the presidency as a public trust and sets a precedent for future executives.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jerusalem Demsas critiques the "toxic modernity narrative" pushed by figures like Arthur Brooks who question if weight-loss drugs like Ozempic rob people of the "satisfaction" of struggle. She argues that treating medical advancements with suspicion ignores the reality that obesity causes nearly 500,000 excess deaths annually and that most diets fail statistically. Demsas writes, "I’ve never asked myself 'Does chemotherapy make cancer patients happy?'... because the purpose of these medical advancements is to either save people’s lives or make them healthier."</p>
