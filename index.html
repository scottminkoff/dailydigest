    <h4>November 20, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 20, 2025 at 6:37 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Donald Trump has accused a group of Democratic lawmakers, all of whom are military or intelligence community veterans, of sedition "punishable by DEATH!" His comments came after they released a video reminding troops that they should not obey illegal orders from the administration. Speaker Mike Johnson defended the president's remarks, telling reporters that Mr. Trump was simply "defining the crime of sedition," while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the posts as dangerous rhetoric. In a separate development, President Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law, which directs the Justice Department to release all unclassified documents related to its investigation of the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days. The bill has significant loopholes, and it is unclear whether the files will be released in full or with redactions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Justice Department's prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey is facing significant hurdles. This week, prosecutors admitted in a court hearing that the full grand jury never reviewed the final indictment against Mr. Comey. According to reporting in a New York Times opinion newsletter by David French, a magistrate judge's opinion detailed numerous other irregularities, including the mishandling of attorney-client privileged communications, potential Fourth Amendment violations during a search, and concerns that the lead prosecutor misled the grand jury. The judge ordered the release of confidential information about the grand jury proceedings, a move that could lay the groundwork for the case's dismissal.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The nation's top political figures, with the notable exceptions of President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, gathered at the Washington National Cathedral for the funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who died at age 84. Former President George W. Bush delivered a tribute, and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney, remembered her father for his "devotion" to the country. Former President Joe Biden was in attendance, as were all living former vice presidents.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In economic news, the U.S. labor market added a stronger-than-expected 119,000 jobs in September, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent, according to a delayed report from the Labor Department. August's payroll numbers were revised to a loss of 4,000 jobs. The data provides an unclear picture for the Federal Reserve, which is split on whether to lower interest rates at its December meeting. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit fell by 24 percent in August, a change driven largely by declining imports resulting from President Trump's tariffs.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On the health front, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was recently altered to include claims that undermine the scientific consensus on vaccines. According to The Bulwark, the site now states that the assertion "vaccines do not cause autism" is "not an evidence-based claim." This change aligns with the long-held anti-vaccine views of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. An HHS spokesperson told CNN the website is being updated to "reflect gold standard, evidence-based science." Separately, top officials at the National Institutes of Health co-authored an article arguing that pandemic preparedness should shift focus from developing vaccines to encouraging Americans to improve their baseline health through diet and exercise, a view that critics say dismisses established germ theory.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Congress, Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Florida Democrat, was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly stealing $5 million in FEMA overpayments and funneling some of the money into her congressional campaign. The indictment has led to a flurry of activity in the House, which is also grappling with a series of censure motions against various members. The House voted to send a motion to censure Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) to the Ethics Committee, and Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) announced plans to introduce a resolution to expel Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday. The meeting follows a period of tension, with Trump having previously labeled Mamdani "my little communist mayor" and threatened to pull federal aid from the city. In a significant local decision, Mamdani announced that current NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch will remain in her post in his administration. The move creates an unlikely partnership between the democratic socialist mayor-elect, who has called for police reform, and a commissioner viewed as conservative on policing issues. According to Hell Gate, Mamdani has become less committal on certain reform promises, such as disbanding the Strategic Response Group, since Tisch agreed to stay on.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mamdani is also navigating internal politics within the city's left. He appeared at a Democratic Socialists of America meeting to urge the group not to endorse City Council Member Chi Ossé’s primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The move highlights a power struggle within the organization that was crucial to Mamdani's own rise.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other New York political news, Rep. Nydia Velázquez, the first Puerto Rican woman elected to Congress, announced she will not seek re-election in 2026. In upstate New York, Assemblymember Robert Smullen became the first Republican to announce a campaign for the congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is running for governor. On the statewide level, Wall Street executive Joseph Hernandez announced his Republican candidacy for state comptroller, challenging incumbent Thomas DiNapoli.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, rejected a challenge to the state's Voting Rights Act. The court ruled that the town of Newburgh, as a political subdivision of the state, could not sue to invalidate a state law. Meanwhile, state legislators are facing pressure to address public safety issues. Democrats are preparing for a debate over reforming a 2017 law that prevents most youth offenders from being tried as adults. In response to recent retail theft, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that a State Police task force has recovered $2.6 million in stolen goods.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">State lawmakers are also grappling with the rise of artificial intelligence. According to POLITICO, New York Democrats are condemning a pending executive order from President Trump that would preempt state-level efforts to regulate AI. Gov. Hochul and Rep. Stefanik are publicly sparring over reproductive health care, including access to in vitro fertilization. In the cannabis industry, the New York Medical Cannabis Industry Association has filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to compel state regulators to crack down on the influx of illicit cannabis sales.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">During a cease-fire, the Israel Defense Forces launched a series of airstrikes on Gaza, which killed at least 25 people, according to the local health ministry. The IDF stated that the strikes were a response to several militants who had opened fire on Israeli forces in southern Gaza, an attack that did not cause any injuries.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's proposed 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine has drawn sharp criticism from Ukrainian and European officials, who view it as a concession to Russia. The plan, drafted in consultation with Russia, would reportedly require Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls and limit the size of its military in exchange for U.S. security guarantees. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is said to be uninterested in the proposal. The backlash comes as Ukraine confirmed it has used U.S.-provided long-range Army Tactical Missiles Systems (ATACMS) to strike targets inside Russia for the first time since President Trump lifted restrictions on their use. Meanwhile, Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones on western Ukraine, killing at least 25 people.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">At the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, debate has surfaced over the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a fee on carbon emitted during the production of imported goods. India and China have pushed back, arguing it amounts to a global carbon tax that would disproportionately harm developing nations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Asia, Japan is moving to restart the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, the world's largest, which was shut down after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Tensions in the region escalated as China suspended seafood imports from Japan in retaliation for comments from the Japanese prime minister implying Japan would defend Taiwan from an invasion. Elsewhere, Mount Semeru, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, erupted, blanketing nearby villages in ash.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Tech companies are racing to develop the next generation of AI-powered devices, focusing on wearable or handheld gadgets that do not require a conventional screen. According to The Atlantic, products like Meta's new smart glasses, which integrate a chatbot into the wearer's field of vision, aim to free users from constant phone-gazing. Other startups are experimenting with AI-enabled pendants and rings. However, this nascent category has seen high-profile failures, such as Humane's AI pin, which was met with brutal reviews. OpenAI, in partnership with former Apple designer Jony Ive, is reportedly developing a screenless, "palm-sized" AI device that will not be wearable.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In business news, Nvidia, the maker of computer chips fueling the AI boom, reported another quarter of soaring profits with revenue of $57 billion, a 62 percent increase from a year ago. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, reached a valuation of $480 billion after a share auction. Adobe announced it is acquiring the digital marketing platform Semrush for $1.9 billion, and Target reported a continued sales decline but announced a new partnership with OpenAI.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York arts world is grappling with the deaths this year of major philanthropists Leonard Lauder and Agnes Gund. According to The New York Times, their passing leaves a massive void at a time when private donations to cultural institutions have plunged and federal arts funding has been gutted. The movie "Wicked: For Good," the second part of the screen adaptation of the Broadway musical, opens in theaters tonight.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the Arkansas state legislature has requested course syllabi, materials, and information about scholarships from the Middle East studies program at the University of Arkansas's flagship campus. Faculty members report that they do not know the reason for the request. Separately, new data shows that the anticipated downturn in foreign student enrollment in the United States is no longer a future concern but is already underway.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that doctors have determined an airline pilot from New Jersey who died last year after eating a hamburger had developed a grave meat allergy from a tick bite. In other news, The Dispatch noted that a January 6 rioter who was pardoned by President Trump has been arrested for child sexual abuse. In the Philippines, a dog that was swept away by a flood found its way home two weeks later.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Dispatch Energy, Roger Pielke Jr. argues that the touted achievements of global climate initiatives like the Paris Agreement are not rooted in reality. He contends that projections of catastrophic warming were based on flawed assumptions about coal use, and that real-world data shows the pace of global decarbonization has not actually accelerated since the 2015 accord. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/dispatch-energy/reassessing-the-worlds-climate-victories/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/dispatch-energy/reassessing-the-worlds-climate-victories/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark's Jonathan V. Last writes that the Trump administration's decision to alter CDC guidance on vaccines and autism represents a dangerous step toward authoritarianism. He argues that by corrupting a previously reliable, apolitical source of government information to fit a political project, the administration is destroying public trust in a way that will have damaging, long-lasting consequences for society. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/is-rfk-jr-worse-than-trump-vaccine">https://www.thebulwark.com/p/is-rfk-jr-worse-than-trump-vaccine</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, David French suggests that the Trump administration's legal incompetence is a "profound mercy" that often interferes with its worst excesses. Citing the procedural chaos in the James Comey prosecution and a botched Texas gerrymander, French argues that Trump's team frequently undermines its own legal positions, but warns that authoritarians who cannot master institutions often seek to destroy them, and the judiciary remains under attack. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/opinion/trump-comey-texas-gerrymander.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/opinion/trump-comey-texas-gerrymander.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Atlantic, Katherine J. Wu critiques the argument from top NIH officials and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that pandemic preparedness should focus on personal health like diet and exercise. Wu states this reflects a dangerous dismissal of germ theory, framing public health as a zero-sum choice between lifestyle improvements and scientific interventions like vaccines, which ignores the societal-level protections needed to stop an outbreak. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/11/robert-f-kennedy-jr-germ-theory-nih-pandemic/684964/">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/11/robert-f-kennedy-jr-germ-theory-nih-pandemic/684964/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Matthew Yglesias argues in Slow Boring that while there are libertarian objections to banning smartphones in schools, such policies are a sensible way to address a collective action problem. He contends that parents cannot solve the issue of smartphone distraction on their own and that creating a better learning environment requires school-wide rules. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/parents-cant-do-this-alone">https://www.slowboring.com/p/parents-cant-do-this-alone</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a New York Times column, Nicole Gelinas writes that New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani may have set a political trap for himself by giving Gov. Kathy Hochul an opening to resist his plans, even popular ones, that could risk harming the state’s economy and budget. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/opinion/hochul-mamdani-new-york-democrats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/opinion/hochul-mamdani-new-york-democrats.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Daily News features an opinion piece by Kei Williams of the NEW Pride Agenda, who argues that Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral victory is a repudiation of the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ+ campaign and that New York must build on this momentum to protect the community from extremist attacks. <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/11/20/build-on-mamdanis-momentum-for-lgbtq-n-y-ers/">https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/11/20/build-on-mamdanis-momentum-for-lgbtq-n-y-ers/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Assembly Members Anna Kelles and Dana Levenberg, writing in the Times Union, argue that there is no good reason for New York to pause the All-Electric Buildings Act, which would transition new buildings away from fossil fuels. <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/electrification-saves-money-energy-spurs-21195028.php">https://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/electrification-saves-money-energy-spurs-21195028.php</a></p></div>
