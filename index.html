    <div class="content"><h4>November 17, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 17, 2025 at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant reversal, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that House Republicans should vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, stating, "we have nothing to hide." The sudden U-turn comes less than 48 hours before a scheduled vote on a bipartisan measure, spearheaded by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), that the White House and GOP leadership had previously worked for months to block. The House Oversight Committee recently released 23,000 documents from the Epstein estate, in which President Trump was reportedly mentioned over 1,600 times. Trump has also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate potential links between Epstein and several prominent Democrats. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is now considering options for a similar vote in the Senate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is attempting to shift its focus to the economy, emphasizing affordability amid polling that shows cost-of-living and inflation are top concerns for voters. Trump is scheduled to speak at a McDonald's-hosted summit tonight on the issue. Last week, the president signed an executive order lifting tariffs on a range of imported food products, including beef and coffee, to help lower grocery prices. This comes as a report from The Century Foundation found that past-due utility balances jumped 9.7 percent annually. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has publicly rejected the notion that the White House is misleading the public about prices going down.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other administration news, David Richardson, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), resigned after a brief and troubled tenure. Separately, a federal magistrate judge ruled that "government misconduct" by lead prosecutor Lindsey Halligan may have imperiled the Justice Department's case against former FBI Director James Comey. The judge cited "fundamental misstatements of the law" made to the grand jury.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on "metering," a policy started under the Obama administration that allows immigration officials to limit the number of foreigners who can request asylum at border crossings. Meanwhile, U.S. Border Patrol agents were deployed to Charlotte, NC, over the weekend to search for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump is moving against Republicans in Indiana who opposed his redistricting effort, planning to endorse a primary challenger to state Sen. Jim Buck. Trump has also invited GOP holdouts to one-on-one meetings at the Oval Office this week to apply pressure. Governor Mike Braun has sided with the president, stating he is committed to passing "fair maps."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a major development on the political right, President Trump defended Tucker Carlson's decision to interview white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Trump stated, "If he wants to interview Nick Fuentes... get the word out... people have to decide." This stance has intensified a rift within the conservative movement, with figures like Sen. Ted Cruz condemning Carlson. Cruz's public feud with Carlson is seen by some as a potential precursor to a 2028 presidential bid.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">With the recent government shutdown concluded, the Federal Aviation Administration has lifted all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed on 40 major airports. However, according to CNN, the shutdown has left Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appearing more politically vulnerable than ever.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Kathy Hochul is preparing for a series of political battles next year, facing federal budget cuts while navigating a new political dynamic with New York City's incoming democratic socialist mayor, Zohran Mamdani. Hochul is reportedly considering some form of non-income tax hike to address the state's fiscal needs and is calling on the federal government to release delayed heating assistance funds. She is also said to have a shortlist of candidates for Lieutenant Governor. Over the weekend, supporters of Mamdani's plan to tax the wealthy rallied in Manhattan, urging the governor to support the agenda. Meanwhile, the state has agreed to delay implementation of its all-electric buildings law pending the outcome of a court case.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's transition is already facing challenges. One of the first tests will be whether the Trump administration grants him the top-level security clearance necessary for the mayor of New York City. Mamdani is also navigating internal political tensions; he has indicated he will not retain city Comptroller Brad Lander in his administration but has reportedly offered to support Lander in a primary challenge against Rep. Dan Goldman. This has caused friction with the NYC-DSA, which has endorsed a different candidate, City Council Member Alexa Avilés, for that seat. Mamdani has stated he is confident in his plan to keep Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner but has not made a formal announcement.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Albany, Assembly Member Stacy Pheffer-Amato announced she will not seek reelection. State Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest have introduced legislation to raise taxes on millionaires in NYC, aligning with Mamdani's agenda. In response, Steven Fulop, the incoming head of the Partnership for New York City, called the proposed corporate tax hikes "absolute suicide" for the city's economy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams is on a multi-day trip to Israel, described as a farewell visit and a show of solidarity amid rising antisemitism. Back in the city, the state Gaming Facility Location Board is touring the three remaining potential sites for a downstate casino license. In other city news, a judge has temporarily blocked a new agreement for the use of Citi Field's parking lot, which could jeopardize the Mets owners' bid to build a casino there.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The race for New York City Council Speaker is moving into a more public phase, with candidates set to participate in a series of forums this week. Meanwhile, City & State released its "2025 Women Power 100" list, which includes Rep. Elise Stefanik, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, and 1199SEIU President Yvonne Armstrong.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City's outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, is on a multi-day trip to Israel which has been described as a farewell tour and a demonstration of solidarity. His visit comes as the United Nations Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution concerning Gaza that suggests a path to Palestinian statehood, a proposal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasized his opposition to.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israeli government has decided to create its own investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 massacre, opting against a traditional state commission of inquiry. According to a report from Axios, the Israeli government is not opposed to Saudi Arabia purchasing U.S. F-35 fighter jets, provided the sale is linked to the normalization of relations between the two countries.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United Kingdom's political landscape is fracturing as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party faces internal turmoil and a net approval rating of -48%. According to The Dispatch, economic stagnation and public anger over high immigration are eroding support for both Labour and the Conservative Party. This has created an opening for three other parties: the far-left Greens, the center-left Liberal Democrats, and the right-populist Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, which is polling at 29%.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In South America, Chile's presidential election is heading to a December runoff between Communist Party candidate Jeannette Jara and right-wing candidate José Antonio Kast, with Kast considered the early favorite. President Trump has signaled a potential diplomatic shift, stating he is open to talks with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as the U.S. increases its military presence in the Caribbean. A recent U.S. airstrike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel in the region killed four people.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is working to resume prisoner-of-war exchanges with Russia and is "rebooting" the country's energy sector amid corruption scandals. Russian missile and drone strikes continue to hit Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, while Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a strike on a Russian oil facility.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In trade news, the U.S. and Switzerland have reached a deal to cut tariffs on Swiss imports. However, European Union officials are warning the U.S. against expanding steel tariffs, arguing it would undermine a recent trade agreement.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A controversy has erupted over comments made by Megyn Kelly on her SiriusXM show regarding Jeffrey Epstein. Kelly stated that a source told her Epstein was not a "pedophile" in the clinical sense of being attracted to prepubescent children, but was instead into "barely legal" teenage girls. The comments sparked widespread backlash, with comedian Patton Oswalt being suspended from the social media platform Bluesky for joking that Kelly should be put through a woodchipper. John Oliver also criticized Kelly for engaging in "pedophile math."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In technology news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly plans to resign as early as 2026, according to the Financial Times. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon also announced plans to retire early next year. In New York, state lawmakers are considering the "RAISE Act," a bill designed to regulate artificial intelligence. A new pro-AI super PAC, backed by over $100 million, has announced it will target the bill's sponsor, Assemblymember Alex Bores, in his congressional campaign.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The first episode of Ken Burns' new documentary, "The American Revolution," debuted on PBS, with critics noting its urgent treatment of slavery. Netflix has also released "Death by Lightning," a four-part drama about the assassination of President James Garfield.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New data reveals that the decline in international student enrollment at U.S. colleges predates the Trump administration. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, a 7-percent drop last fall was precipitated by waning interest in master's and professional programs. Preliminary figures suggest the trend may worsen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from fining the University of California system or withholding federal grants. The administration had threatened the penalties over allegations of discrimination and concerns about antisemitic civil rights violations on campus.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other news, Bard College and the Episcopal Diocese of New York are seeking the release of an Afghan immigrant, Ali Faqirzada, who was detained by federal immigration officials after a routine appointment.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a Thanksgiving news release, Warren Buffett announced that Greg Abel will take over writing Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letter. Buffett used the announcement to reflect on his legacy and the effects of aging. Separately, America250.org and the White House Historical Association have unveiled a limited-edition ornament celebrating the nation's upcoming 250th anniversary.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In *Slow Boring*, Matthew Yglesias argues that the group of Democratic senators who pushed to end the recent government shutdown should not be labeled "moderates." He contends that true moderation involves aligning with public priorities, whereas these senators acted to protect federal employees and preserve the filibuster, prioritizing specific policy outcomes over a political fight that could have weakened President Trump, even at the cost of some short-term public hardship. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation">https://www.slowboring.com/p/folding-a-winning-hand-isnt-moderation</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The *Daily News* editorial board features an op-ed by Comptroller Brad Lander and Jamie Beran of Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, who write that in the face of rising antisemitism, the Jewish community must confront deep tensions about its identity, especially in the context of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's victory. <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42570141.34601/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTYvem9ocmFuLW1hbWRhbmktYW5kLW55Y3MtamV3cy13aGF0LWtpbmQtb2YtamV3aXNoLWNvbW11bml0eS1kby13ZS13YW50LXRvLWJlLz9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/6911422cbc83b78ed0f436fCe6649ec9">https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42570141.34601/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTYvem9ocmFuLW1hbWRhbmktYW5kLW55Y3MtamV3cy13aGF0LWtpbmQtb2YtamV3aXNoLWNvbW11bml0eS1kby13ZS13YW50LXRvLWJlLz9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/6911422cbc83b78ed0f436fCe6649ec9</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In *Jewish Currents*, Gabi Kirk argues that a new "antisemitism prevention" law in California is part of a broader campaign against ethnic studies curricula and, ironically, makes it more difficult to engage with the evolving nature of Jewish identity. <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss">https://jewishcurrents.org/in-california-jewish-groups-win-is-students-loss</a></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A *Singal-Minded* piece by Jesse Singal examines the public controversy surrounding Megyn Kelly's comments on Jeffrey Epstein. He notes the strong resistance to using more precise clinical terms like "ephebophile" or "hebephile," even when they might more accurately describe Epstein's behavior than the colloquial term "pedophile." <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/is-it-okay-to-call-jeffrey-epstein">https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/is-it-okay-to-call-jeffrey-epstein</a></p>
