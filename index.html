    <div class="content"><h4>November 24, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch reports that a bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing for a vote this year on the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would ban members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. The bill would still permit investments in diversified mutual funds and ETFs. Despite broad public support, some members, like Rep. Tim Burchett, are skeptical the bill will pass the Senate even if it clears the House, citing past failures of similar legislation.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Politico reports that President Trump is expected to unveil the "Healthcare Price Cuts Act," a proposal that includes a two-year extension of Obamacare subsidies but with new eligibility limits. The plan would cap subsidies for individuals with incomes up to 700 percent of the federal poverty line and require minimum premium payments. The proposal comes less than six weeks before the current subsidies are set to expire.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation from Congress was driven by a sense of betrayal by former President Trump, disgust with the Republican Party, and fear from death threats apparently from Trump supporters. In a video message, Greene stated she wanted to avoid a "hurtful and hateful primary" initiated by Trump, who had recently attacked his former ally, calling her a "traitor."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Politico reports that the Associated Press is returning to court to challenge the White House's decision to revoke its access to the Oval Office. The conflict began after the AP refused President Trump's decree to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America." The case centers on whether the government can retaliate against journalists for their reporting and use of language, a key First Amendment issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State First Read reports that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, seven years after her initial election, has adapted to Washington's "inside game" and is reportedly considering a future run for the Senate or the presidency.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch reports that the Trump administration is suing California's state government and its public higher-education systems for providing in-state college tuition and other state-subsidized benefits to undocumented immigrants.</p>
<ul><li>Associated Press: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-students-immigrants-illegally-us-trump-uc-f459713b0fd5e2a7f5ea1a5e74e203c3">Trump administration sues California over in-state tuition for illegal immigrants</a></li></ul>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Politico reports that Democrats in Texas are optimistic about their chances in the 2026 midterm elections, even if a Republican-drawn redistricting map is upheld in court. Citing a "Latino buyer’s remorse" from the 2024 election and recent polling data, strategists believe they can flip key seats in South Texas, which were targeted by the GOP after showing significant support for Donald Trump.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that FBI Director Kash Patel is facing internal scrutiny for his heavy use of taxpayer-funded resources, including using the agency’s SWAT teams to protect his girlfriend, right-wing activist Alexis Wilkins, and frequent travel on government jets.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kottke.org reports that CDC officials have confirmed the U.S. is approximately two months away from measles being reclassified as an endemic disease for the first time since 2000. Elimination status is lost if the virus spreads continuously for a 12-month period.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Politico New York Playbook reports that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is resetting political expectations through a series of strategic moves that defy easy categorization. In one week, he had a surprisingly friendly meeting with President Trump, where they found common ground on issues like high Con Edison rates; retained NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, a move popular with moderates; and discouraged the Democratic Socialists of America from endorsing a primary challenger to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Times Union reports that President Donald Trump publicly disagreed with Rep. Elise Stefanik's characterization of NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani as a "jihadist." After a positive meeting with Mamdani, Trump stated Stefanik, who is running for governor of New York, was just "out there campaigning."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that abuse of inmates by guards in New York's prison system is increasing, according to state records and interviews. Despite guards' claims that they use force more often due to rising danger, a Times analysis found that assaults on staff have decreased, while incidents of guards restraining and asphyxiating inmates have risen.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State NY reports on speculation over who might run to succeed Rep. Nydia Velázquez following her retirement announcement.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State First Read reports that NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch apologized to the congregation of Manhattan's Park East Synagogue for the police response to a pro-Palestinian protest outside the building last week, which she acknowledged turned into "turmoil."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State First Read reports that the Grieving Families Act has once again been sent to Gov. Kathy Hochul. The bipartisan bill, which would change New York's wrongful death statute to allow families to recover damages for emotional suffering, has been vetoed by the governor three times previously.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch reports the Israel Defense Forces killed Hezbollah's military chief of staff, Haytham Tabatabai, in a targeted airstrike in Beirut. The strike hit a multi-story building Israel said housed terrorist infrastructure. Separately, the IDF struck Hamas targets in Gaza, killing at least five senior members after Hamas militants reportedly fired on Israeli soldiers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting to address rising settler violence in the West Bank, and prosecutors filed terrorism-related charges against an Israeli teen for an alleged attack on a Palestinian village.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that the Israeli military plans to oust or discipline about a dozen senior commanders for failures related to the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports that American and Ukrainian officials are making progress in Geneva on a U.S.-proposed peace plan to end the war with Russia. The plan, which initially read like a Russian "wish list," would require Kyiv to relinquish territory, shrink its army, and bar it from joining NATO. After Ukrainian outrage, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the talks were "narrowing the differences." President Trump, who set a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to accept, has suggested it is not his "final offer" while also lashing out at Ukraine for a perceived lack of gratitude for U.S. aid.</p>

In response, many public schools in the region have been temporarily closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Politico reports that Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine is in the Caribbean to inspect a major U.S. naval buildup near Venezuela as the Trump administration's campaign against President Nicolás Maduro intensifies. The visit coincides with a new State Department designation of a group called Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, with Maduro named as its head. This is expected to open new options for U.S. action, and Reuters reported that President Trump has approved some form of covert action against the Venezuelan government.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Slow Boring, guest contributor Chris Dalla Riva argues that long copyright terms are a hidden cause of cultural stagnation. He contends that the current system, which protects works for 70 years after an author's death or 95 years for corporate works, creates a massive financial incentive for investors to endlessly remarket, repackage, and relitigate past hits—from music biopics to samples—at the expense of new creative works.
