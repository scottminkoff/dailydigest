    <div class="content"><h4>November 21, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the September jobs report seven weeks late due to the government shutdown. According to The Dispatch, the U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs, exceeding expectations, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent. The October report has been canceled, and November's release will be delayed. Politico notes this data offers a murky picture for the Federal Reserve as it debates interest rate cuts in December.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump signed the "Epstein Files Transparency Act" into law, requiring the Attorney General to release all unclassified documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation within 30 days. However, The New York Times reports that the bill contains loopholes and the signature does not guarantee a full release. In related legal news, federal prosecutors admitted in court that a full grand jury never reviewed the final indictment against former FBI Director James Comey; only the foreperson and one other juror saw the document.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Republicans’ efforts to redraw congressional districts are facing significant headwinds. The New York Times reports that G.O.P. redistricting pushes in Texas, Indiana, Utah, and Ohio have stalled or been struck down by courts. A federal panel ruled that a new Texas map violated the Voting Rights Act, and the Indiana State Senate failed to redraw its map. Consequently, Democrats may narrowly win this cycle's redistricting wars. Politico adds that Indiana Senate GOP leader Rodric Bray has resisted pressure from the White House to aggressively gerrymander, citing the need to preserve trust in the institution.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.) has been indicted on charges of stealing $5 million in federal disaster relief funds and funneling money into her congressional campaign. Additionally, the House unanimously passed a bill repealing a provision that allowed senators to sue the government for damages if their phone records were subpoenaed without notice.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its website regarding vaccines and autism. The Bulwark reports the site now states that studies "have not ruled out the possibility" of a link, a departure from previous absolute language, reflecting the influence of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is scheduled to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office today. According to Politico, the meeting occurs amid threats from the White House to cut federal aid and deploy the National Guard to the city. Mamdani aims to discuss affordability and public safety, despite previously trading attacks with the President. In a separate development, Mamdani urged the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) not to endorse City Council Member Chi Ossé’s primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, arguing it could fracture the coalition that swept him into office.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Rep. Nydia Velázquez, the first Puerto Rican woman elected to Congress, announced she will retire at the end of her term in 2026. Politico reports that her departure opens a seat in a deep-blue district covering parts of Brooklyn and Queens, likely triggering a crowded primary. Potential contenders include state Sen. Julia Salazar and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. Meanwhile, Republican Assembly Member Robert Smullen announced he will run for the congressional seat being vacated by Elise Stefanik.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor-elect Mamdani announced that current NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch will remain in her role. The New York Times characterizes this as an "odd couple" partnership between a democratic socialist mayor and a conservative commissioner, aimed at demonstrating stability and a commitment to public safety. Both issued statements pledging to work together despite differing views on bail reform and police staffing.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York’s highest court rejected a challenge to the New York Voting Rights Act brought by the town of Newburgh. According to the Times Union, the Court of Appeals ruled that the town could not sue to invalidate a state law, clearing a hurdle for the legislation designed to boost minority voting power.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that Hamas violated the six-week-old ceasefire agreement by firing on troops. The Dispatch reports that the IDF responded with airstrikes across Gaza. The local health ministry in Gaza reported at least 25 people killed in the strikes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio regarding the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu stated he received assurances that Israel would maintain its "qualitative military edge" in the region. Meanwhile, The Dispatch reports that Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians in several West Bank villages, drawing condemnation from Israeli officials.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times reports on a surge in attendance at Orthodox Christian parishes in the U.S., particularly among conservative young men. Dubbed "Orthobros" by some, these converts are reportedly drawn to the faith's demanding requirements and traditional structures.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has proposed a 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, drafted in consultation with Russia. According to Axios and Politico, the plan would require Ukraine to cede territory, create a demilitarized zone, and shrink its army in exchange for security guarantees. Ukrainian officials have reacted with alarm, viewing the proposal as capitulation. Concurrently, Ukraine confirmed it used U.S.-made long-range ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time since restrictions were lifted.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A public inquiry in the United Kingdom found that the government's early response to the COVID-19 pandemic was "too little, too late," contributing to over 20,000 avoidable deaths. The Dispatch notes the report cited a failure to appreciate the scale of the threat.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump signaled an intent to become involved in the civil war in Sudan, stating that the Saudi Crown Prince requested he "do something very powerful" to seek peace in the region.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nuclear power is seeing a resurgence in the United States, driven by the energy demands of AI data centers. The Dispatch reports that the Department of Energy approved a $1 billion loan to restart the nuclear facility at Three Mile Island, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, to power Microsoft data centers. The administration is also pivoting away from renewable subsidies toward nuclear and fossil fuels.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump is preparing to issue an executive order that would preempt state efforts to regulate artificial intelligence. Politico reports that the order would launch an "AI Litigation Task Force" to challenge state laws, a move condemned by New York lawmakers who have been leading efforts to place guardrails on the technology.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled the design for a new advanced female crash test dummy, the THOR-05F. This represents a regulatory step toward mandating its use in safety testing, as current female dummies represent only 5 percent of American women by size.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The University of Arkansas flagship campus received a request from a state legislative office for syllabi related to Middle East studies courses, sparking confusion and concern among faculty regarding the motive behind the inquiry. Additionally, The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that a downturn in foreign student enrollment is already underway, confirmed by recent data.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A Pennsylvania court ruled that a home seller was not legally required to disclose the presence of a swastika tiled into the basement floor to the buyers. Separately, doctors determined that a New Jersey airline pilot who died last year suffered from a severe meat allergy caused by a tick bite.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City's arts philanthropy landscape has been significantly altered by the deaths of major patrons Leonard Lauder and Agnes Gund. The New York Times reports that institutions are struggling to fill the financial void left by these "all-in-one philanthropists" amid declining private donations and federal funding cuts.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times' Nate Cohn analyzes the Republican push for redistricting, arguing that it is at risk of backfiring. Cohn notes that legal setbacks in multiple states and aggressive Democratic counter-measures mean Republicans might gain only a narrow advantage, or none at all, potentially costing them the House in a "blue wave" environment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for The Dispatch, Kevin D. Williamson argues that the White House's proposed peace plan for Ukraine is a "lead balloon." He suggests that while the plan aims to freeze the conflict, the administration's indifference to the victor and willingness to pressure Zelensky into concessions could lead to a settlement that leaves Ukraine defenseless and emboldens adversaries.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, David French contends that the incompetence of the Trump administration's legal team is interfering with its agenda. French highlights the "staggering procedural irregularities" in the prosecution of James Comey and the DOJ's "scathing" loss in the Texas redistricting case as examples where ineptitude has inadvertently served as a check on power.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Katherine J. Wu writes in The Atlantic that the philosophy promoted by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—which dismisses germ theory in favor of nutrition and lifestyle as the primary defense against disease—is dangerous when applied to pandemic preparedness. She argues this "miasma theory" approach ignores the reality that pathogens can fell even healthy individuals.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nicole Gelinas writes in The New York Times that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has no mandate to "steamroll" state government. She argues Governor Hochul should assert herself before negotiations begin, as Mamdani's affordability plans could have negative impacts on the state's budget and economy.</p>
