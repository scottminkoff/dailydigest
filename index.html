        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
President Trump has engaged in a series of aggressive foreign interventions over the holidays, including the reported capture of Venezuela's president and strikes in Nigeria, marking a sharp departure from his campaign's "America First" isolationist rhetoric. This shift suggests a new doctrine where the U.S. actively leverages military power to pursue specific enemies or aid allies, such as threatening intervention in Iran to protect protesters. <em>The Atlantic</em> notes the administration has been "doubling down on foreign interventions," with Trump stating the U.S. is "locked and loaded" regarding Tehran.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City mayor, immediately signing an executive order to rescind all measures issued by predecessor Eric Adams after his indictment. The inauguration, attended by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, signaled a pivot toward leftist governance, with Mamdani promising to use City Hall's power to "improve New Yorkers’ lives" and reject private sector reliance. During his address, Mamdani declared, "We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism."

The New York legislative session begins next week facing a projected $4.2 billion revenue gap, largely driven by federal changes to health care spending. Governor Hochul is pushing for agency efficiencies to avoid income tax hikes, setting up a potential conflict with legislative Democrats who are projecting higher revenue estimates. <em>Capitol Confidential</em> notes that "stronger tax collections have helped close" the gap from a previously projected $7.5 billion.

The City of Kingston has filed a lawsuit against the state Division of Homes and Community Renewal to remove the Stony Run apartment complex from the Emergency Tenant Protection Act. The city aims to reinstate a workforce regulatory agreement, though housing advocates argue this move will lead to rent increases for tenants. The <em>Daily Freeman</em> reports the suit seeks to "reinstate workforce deal and remove it from ETPA."

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Mayor Mamdani's decision to revoke Adams-era executive orders—specifically those banning city cooperation with the BDS movement and adopting the IHRA definition of antisemitism—has drawn sharp condemnation from Israeli officials and Jewish organizations. Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Minister labeled the new mayor a "supporter of terrorism," while the World Jewish Congress warned that weakening tools to recognize antisemitism is a "dangerous signal." <em>The Free Press</em> notes this move was the very first action of Mamdani's "new era."

New reports indicate that just one month prior to the October 7 attacks, the Israeli government asked Qatar to increase its funding payments to Hamas following threats of escalation from the terror group. In separate revelations regarding captivity in Gaza, former hostage Romi Gonen disclosed that a senior Hamas official offered to prioritize her release if she remained silent about sexual assaults she endured. <em>Haaretz</em> highlights that the funding request was conveyed to Qatar's envoy "on behalf of the Israeli government at a Jerusalem meeting."

President Trump announced the U.S. military has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro following a "large scale strike" and months of military buildup in the Caribbean. The operation, described by Trump as "brilliant," involved the C.I.A. and airstrikes, prompting the Venezuelan government to declare a state of emergency. <em>The New York Times</em> reports that earlier today, Trump confirmed the U.S. was "flying him out of the country."

A devastating fire at a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana during New Year's Eve celebrations has resulted in approximately 40 deaths and over 100 injuries. Investigators believe sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited the blaze, which caused a flashover explosion in the enclosed space. <em>The New York Times</em> reports the number of severe burn victims "exceeds the capacity" of Switzerland's burn units.

<h4><b>CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
A growing segment of the American public is expressing hostility toward artificial intelligence, driven by fears of job displacement and a general distrust of tech companies inherited from the social media era. Unlike other developed democracies that view AI with optimism, Americans view the technology through a lens of skepticism regarding data privacy and corporate motives. <em>The New York Times</em> notes that nearly "three-quarters of Americans expect A.I. to slash jobs."

The rise of streaming and internet ubiquity is fundamentally altering sports fandom by allowing fans to maintain allegiances to non-local teams, potentially threatening the traditional geographic model of professional sports. This "delocalization" means parents are passing down long-distance fandom to their children rather than adopting local teams, decoupling the fan experience from the city they live in. Matthew Yglesias observes that "dads maintaining their hometown sports allegiances and passing them on to their sons" poses a long-term threat to the business model.

In a heartwarming recap of pop culture moments, Rian Johnson has broken down scenes from his new film <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>, discussing how his evangelical upbringing influenced the movie's themes. The film serves as a way for the director to reconcile his past religious perspectives with his current worldview. <em>Kottke.org</em> highlights this as a conversation between "those perspectives inside me."

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Zohran Mamdani’s use of the phrase "the warmth of collectivism" in his inaugural address betrays a dangerous ignorance of the historical atrocities associated with collectivization under Soviet and Maoist regimes. The speech signals a governance style rooted in theoretical "old bad ideas" rather than empirical evidence, ignoring the catastrophic human costs historically linked to such rhetoric. Goldberg writes, "No serious person can claim that 'true collectivism was never really tried,' in part because... collectivization is the fully realized act of putting collectivism into practice."

The theory that politics has become "post-material"—meaning voters care more about culture than economics—is flawed; instead, material conditions like high prices and interest rates are the primary drivers of voter behavior. Polling suggests that culture war issues like transgender rights often poll negatively for Republicans, yet they win due to economic dissatisfaction and the class composition of the electorate. Maia Mindel argues that "politics has become <em>more</em> economic... because economic conditions determine who turns up to vote."
