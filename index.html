<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Senate Democrats are threatening to withhold Department of Homeland Security funding unless significant reforms are implemented following the fatal shooting of a protester by federal agents in Minnesota. The standoff risks a partial government shutdown at the end of the week, though reports suggest the White House may agree to separate the DHS bill to keep the rest of the government open. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded specific changes, including body cameras and bans on roving patrols, stating, "In the wake of ICE’s abuses and the administration’s recklessness, the Senate must not pass the DHS budget as currently written."

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The FBI executed a court-authorized search of an election facility in Fulton County, Georgia, seizing records related to the 2020 election as part of an ongoing federal investigation. This action aligns with the Trump administration's continued focus on unproven claims of election fraud, following a Justice Department lawsuit filed in December seeking access to similar materials. Fulton County officials confirmed the agents sought "a number of records related to 2020 elections," marking a significant escalation in the federal probe into the county’s electoral operations.

The Federal Reserve voted to leave interest rates unchanged at a target range of 3.5 to 3.75 percent, resisting pressure from the Trump administration for further cuts. Chairman Jerome Powell cited solid economic expansion and the need to let data "light the way," while acknowledging a "clear improvement" in the economic outlook since December. Powell defended the central bank's independence against White House scrutiny, stating that autonomy has "enabled central banks generally not to be perfect, but to serve the public well."

<h4><b>2. NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani warned of a projected $12 billion budget deficit over the next two years, blaming the shortfall on his predecessor while ruling out service cuts. Mamdani is pressuring Governor Kathy Hochul to authorize tax hikes on wealthy residents and corporations to fill the gap, though Hochul has indicated she is not interested in raising taxes during an election year. The Mayor insisted, "It’s as easy as ABC: This is the Adams budget crisis," while vague promises of "efficiencies" drew skepticism from fiscal watchdogs.

The Hochul administration and state utility regulators are considering modifications to New York's ambitious climate law, potentially rolling back mandates for 70 percent renewable electricity by 2030 due to reliability and cost concerns. A petition from business groups has asked the Public Service Commission to utilize a "safety valve" provision to suspend mandates, a move that could upend budget negotiations with the legislature. Environmental advocates argue this signals the state is "giving serious weight to claims that echo its own recent, fossil-centric framing."

A federal judge expressed skepticism regarding the Trump administration’s legal arguments for killing New York City’s congestion pricing program, questioning the president's authority to void a contract approved by the previous administration. The court battle continues as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced the tolls generated $562 million in their first year, funds critical for transit infrastructure. The judge notably asked if the move was comparable to "ripping down the East Wing and building a new East Wing."

The Israeli government has reportedly approved the reconstruction of "New Rafah" in southern Gaza, contingent on Hamas committing to disarm within 100 days. This decision, made in response to a U.S. request, aims to separate areas under the control of a new technocratic committee from those controlled by Hamas. A European diplomat noted that negotiations over daily entry quotas at the Rafah crossing are ongoing, despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's public cap of 50 families per day.

A motorist rammed a vehicle into the Chabad-Lubavitch world headquarters in Brooklyn multiple times on Wednesday night, an incident police are investigating as a potential hate crime. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani rushed to the scene at 770 Eastern Parkway, where the driver was reportedly heard making antisemitic statements before being apprehended. The attack targeted one of the most significant sites for the Chabad movement, though no injuries were reported inside the building.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that intelligence indicates Russia is preparing a "new massive strike" targeting the country's energy infrastructure and civilians. This warning followed overnight attacks that killed two civilians near Kyiv and injured children, as Russian forces reportedly increase their use of Starlink-equipped drones for strikes. Zelensky urged Western allies to recognize how these continued escalations "discredit diplomatic talks."

<h4><b>8. OPINION</b></h4>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The Trump administration’s aggressive immigration tactics in Minnesota have backfired, turning public sentiment against ICE and fracturing the "united front of Trumpism." While the White House attempts to scapegoat officials like Kristi Noem for the violence, the true driver of the policy remains Stephen Miller and the President's own rhetoric. Josh Marshall argues, "A goon squad that was designed to behave like a goon squad behaved like a goon squad."

In a time of increasing governmental lawlessness, legal academics face a moral obligation to scrutinize the "Dual State"—where a normative legal order exists alongside unchecked executive prerogative. Drawing parallels to the decline of German universities in the 1930s, Steve Vladeck warns that "professional myopia" and "personal opportunism" can lead scholars to normalize authoritarian overreach. He argues it is incumbent upon public law scholars to confront the reality of the state's actions rather than retreating into theoretical abstractions.

Despite GDP growth, consumer confidence has hit its lowest level since 2014, driven by a wave of layoffs across major sectors like tech and retail and the inflationary impact of tariffs. Jonathan V. Last argues that the economy is suffering from "Trump’s Big Suck," where instability and government interventionism are stagnating real growth. He notes, "The Trump economy isn’t a hellscape, exactly—but the uncertainty and fear are mounting."
