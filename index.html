    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A major rift has emerged between former President Trump and one of his staunchest congressional allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). After Greene advocated for the full release of the Justice Department's files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and criticized Trump on cost-of-living issues, Trump publicly broke with her. In social media posts, he called her a "ranting lunatic" and a "traitor," and signaled his support for a primary challenge against her. Appearing on CNN's "State of the Union," Greene said Trump's comments were "hurtful" and put her life in danger, while stating she is trying to move away from "toxic politics."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The intra-party dispute comes as the House prepares to vote on Tuesday on a bipartisan bill that would force the release of the Epstein records. The measure, brought forward by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna (D-CA), is gaining momentum, with Massie predicting a "deluge" of Republican support and warning colleagues that a vote against it would be remembered as a vote to "protect pedophiles." Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that Trump is not worried about the files' release.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the aftermath of the recent government shutdown, a CBS poll found that 55 percent of Americans believe Republicans got more of what they wanted, compared to just 6 percent for Democrats. The shutdown has elevated the focus on healthcare, with some moderate House Republicans now pushing for a deal on expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent premium hikes. Democrats are also focusing on the issue, criticizing HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine positions. Meanwhile, funding for food stamps through the SNAP program has resumed, though millions are expected to lose benefits in the coming months due to Republican-led cuts.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has significantly altered the Department of Homeland Security's focus to prioritize its deportation campaign. According to a New York Times investigation, this has involved diverting thousands of agents from other law enforcement duties, slowing down investigations into child exploitation, sex trafficking, and the black market for Iranian oil. A federal immigration crackdown is currently underway in Charlotte, N.C., with Border Patrol agents making numerous arrests. The next target is reportedly New Orleans in an operation dubbed "Catahoula Crunch." In a related development, The Dispatch reports that DHS is using nativist messaging in its recruitment efforts, framing its mission as preserving a specific view of American culture.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Newly released financial disclosures show that former President Trump has purchased at least $82 million in bonds since late August. He has also pardoned two more individuals for crimes related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and is reportedly recasting the U.S. foreign terror list to focus on "antifa" and drug cartels.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new ethics controversy has emerged at the Federal Reserve. According to Bloomberg, Adriana Kugler’s surprise departure from the Fed in August was prompted by an investigation into her violation of ethics rules for trading individual stocks.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Internal turmoil continues to roil the conservative movement, particularly at the Heritage Foundation. According to The Dispatch, Heritage President Kevin Roberts sparked outrage from staffers after he defended Tucker Carlson for providing a friendly platform to white nationalist Nick Fuentes. The incident has highlighted a broader identity crisis on the right regarding its relationship with reactionary and antisemitic elements. Vice President JD Vance has remained largely silent on the controversy, a stance his critics, as noted in The New York Times, describe as "groyper adjacent."</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Brooklyn Democratic Party is attempting to unify its 17-member City Council delegation to act as a more influential bloc in the upcoming race for City Council speaker. According to City & State, party leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is working to bring progressives and moderates together to avoid the borough getting "the short end of the stick." The current front-runners are considered to be Julie Menin and Crystal Hudson, with Amanda Farías seen as a potential compromise candidate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mets owner Steve Cohen's bid to build a casino near Citi Field has hit a potential snag. A judge has ordered New York City to temporarily halt any new agreement with Cohen over the use of the stadium's parking lot, which is central to the development plan.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants. The move could expand federal detention capacity in the city as it escalates immigration enforcement. In New York, the federal use of county jails for immigrant detention has already surged this year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are once again flowing to nearly 3 million New Yorkers. However, the period without funding was described by one city official as a "nail-biting scramble" that was "entirely avoidable."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In state news, conservationists are again urging Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign a bill banning the harvesting of horseshoe crabs, a measure she vetoed last year. Separately, officials from the Brooklyn Hospital Center are warning that the facility may be forced to close by the end of the year without financial assistance from the state.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The SUNY Board of Trustees has taken the unusual step of formally rejecting the nomination of Maria Conzatti to lead Nassau Community College, escalating a power struggle that has lasted for over three years.</p>

Gawande states that an estimated 600,000 people have already died as a result of the cuts, including 400,000 children.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly considering military options in Venezuela. The president has held high-level meetings on the issue with officials including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

However, doctors express concern about the potential for chatbots to provide incomplete or inaccurate information for high-stakes health decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On Saturday, the cable news channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW. The change, part of a reported $20 million effort, comes as the network faces a significant decline in its audience and a splintering media landscape where podcasts and YouTube have diminished the role of traditional cable news.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Scientists have made a genetic breakthrough by sequencing RNA from a 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth mummy named Yuka. As reported by 404 Media, this is by far the oldest RNA ever sequenced, pushing the timeline back by 25,000 years.
