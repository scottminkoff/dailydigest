<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Republicans in Utah are organizing a repeal of an anti-gerrymandering measure, Proposition 4, in a bid to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2028 cycle. If successful, the GOP-controlled legislature could potentially redraw district lines four times within an eight-year span, a frequency critics argue imposes an "overwhelming burden" on the electoral system. The effort is being bolstered by national GOP funding and organizations linked to the Trump administration.

Nearly a year into his second term, President Trump’s deportation numbers have reached roughly 600,000, falling short of his 1 million benchmark despite historically low border crossings. While the White House claims to be conducting the largest operation against "criminal illegal aliens," internal data suggests that over 60 percent of recent ICE arrests involve individuals with no criminal convictions. Conservative allies are urging the administration to expand the crackdown further to meet campaign promises.

President Trump reportedly intervened to ease federal marijuana restrictions, siding with industry executives over the objections of Speaker Mike Johnson. The policy shift, influenced by meetings at Mar-a-Lago with cannabis CEO Kim Rivers and a Florida sheriff, marks a significant departure from traditional federal drug enforcement. Trump was persuaded that rescheduling the drug would be less dangerous to Americans than the status quo.

An Iranian hacker group known as "Handala" claims to have breached the phone of Prime Minister Netanyahu's chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, and is threatening to release sensitive data connecting Israeli officials to Qatar. The group has already leaked photos of alleged "lavish" Shabbat dinners, framing them as venues for secret political networking. This follows a pattern of "hack-and-leak" operations by the group intended to destabilize Israeli leadership.

Israeli prosecutors are seeking the extradition of former Netanyahu campaign adviser Israel "Srulik" Einhorn from Serbia in connection with the ongoing "Qatargate" and "BibiLeaks" investigations. Separately, former spokesman Eli Feldstein told investigators that a senior official in the Prime Minister's Office claimed he could "silence" an IDF probe into classified leaks. Far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir condemned those involved in the scandal but maintained that Netanyahu himself was not complicit.

Violence in the West Bank has flared with a reported car torching and "revenge" graffiti in Hawara, while the IDF detained a Palestinian suspect following a shooting incident near the Hashmonaim checkpoint. Italian authorities also arrested nine people suspected of funneling over 7 million euros to Hamas through charitable organizations. In a separate incident, the IDF extracted two Jewish Israelis who had entered the Palestinian city of Tulkarm while reportedly under the influence of alcohol.

The UN Security Council has scheduled an emergency session to address Israel's unprecedented recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland. While Israel is the first nation to grant such recognition, President Trump expressed skepticism about the move, reportedly asking, "Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?"

Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope believe they have detected light from Population III stars, the very first stars to form in the universe over 13 billion years ago. The light, magnified by a gravitational lens from the galaxy LAP1-B, contains specific low-metal signatures that match theoretical predictions for these primordial celestial bodies. This discovery potentially offers the first direct observational evidence of the universe's earliest stellar generation.

New research has seemingly resolved a decades-long paleontological debate, confirming that <i>Nanotyrannus</i> was a distinct species rather than a juvenile <i>T. rex</i>. Evidence from a near-complete skeleton dubbed "Bloody Mary" indicates these smaller predators coexisted with their larger counterparts at the end of the Cretaceous period. The findings are prompting a significant reevaluation of existing scholarship on tyrannosaurs.

Analysis of remains from a 1559 Spanish shipwreck in Florida has identified the earliest known domestic cats in the continental United States. The study revealed the cat's diet consisted of nutritious fish and domestic meat rather than rodents, suggesting it was highly valued and effective at pest control. This discovery provides new insight into the role of animals in early European maritime expeditions.
