    <div class="content"><h4>November 23, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump held a meeting at the White House with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Despite previously exchanging insults, the interaction was described as cordial, with the President calling Mamdani a "rational person" and expressing interest in his housing agenda. This meeting has reportedly caused friction within the MAGA movement, confusing some supporters who viewed Mamdani as a political adversary. Meanwhile, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will resign from Congress effective January 5. Greene, formerly a staunch Trump ally, has recently broken with the President on issues including foreign policy and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files; Trump publicly welcomed her resignation as "great news."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In immigration news, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents conducted a series of raids in North Carolina, specifically targeting Charlotte and Durham. Local officials, including the Governor and mayors, stated they were not informed of the operations in advance, leading to confusion and fear within the communities. The Trump administration also announced it would revoke the temporary protected status of Somali migrants, citing money laundering concerns in Minnesota.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Regarding healthcare, the Trump administration announced fraud convictions involving two men who enrolled homeless individuals in Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans to collect commissions. Administration officials are citing these convictions to argue for cuts to ACA subsidies. However, experts argue that while enrollment schemes exist, they are often facilitated by simplified enrollment processes introduced during Trump's first term, and that cutting subsidies could harm patients with pre-existing conditions. Additionally, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated he instructed the CDC to remove language asserting that vaccines do not cause autism.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other developments, a federal court blocked Texas' newly drawn congressional map, though the Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay. The Department of Justice is facing scrutiny over its handling of the prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey and is renewing efforts to release grand jury records related to Jeffrey Epstein. Unemployment has ticked up to 4.4 percent, and the President has rolled back certain tariffs on food and Swiss goods in an effort to lower prices.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following his White House visit, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's incoming chief of staff stated that President Trump understands New York City is a "special place" and indicated a willingness to collaborate on making the city more livable. Conversely, outgoing Mayor Eric Adams will break with tradition by not hosting a final annual holiday celebration at Gracie Mansion. In the House of Representatives, longtime Democratic Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez announced she will retire, signaling a desire for generational change.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In legal news, federal prosecutors defended their decision to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of assassinating the UnitedHealthcare CEO. Additionally, a detainee on Rikers Island died after an apparent seizure just hours before he was set to plead guilty and be released. Governor Kathy Hochul also discussed her reelection strategy, emphasizing her intent to navigate the upcoming political landscape aggressively.</p>
