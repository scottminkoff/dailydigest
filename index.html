President Trump is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago today to discuss a 20-point peace plan intended to end the war in Ukraine. While Zelenskyy has reportedly agreed to various compromises, significant differences regarding territorial concessions remain, and Trump has emphasized that any final deal requires his specific approval. The high-stakes meeting occurs as Kyiv endures aggressive new assaults on its energy grid from Russian forces.

The Trump administration is facing criticism from both the right and the left regarding its immigration crackdown, as deportation numbers lag significantly behind the president's campaign promise of one million. While border crossings have hit historic lows and arrests have surged to nearly 600,000, conservative allies argue the operation is inefficient, while civil rights advocates warn of widespread fear within immigrant communities. One DHS official stated that while 600,000 people were deported, another 1.9 million have "self-deported" during the administration's tenure.

In Utah, the Republican-controlled legislature is maneuvering to repeal a voter-approved anti-gerrymandering measure to allow for a new congressional map redraw ahead of the 2028 cycle. If the repeal effort succeeds, the state could see its congressional maps redrawn four times within an eight-year span, granting the GOP significant control over the process before the 2030 census. National Republican groups are pouring resources into the effort to gather signatures for a ballot initiative to overturn Proposition 4.

An Iranian hacker group known as "Handala" claims to have compromised the phone of Prime Minister Netanyahu's chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, and is threatening to release sensitive information. The group alleges the data reveals ties between Netanyahu's aides and Qatar, and they have previously released footage of Braverman allegedly holding "lavish" Shabbat dinners. This follows reports that the State Prosecutor is seeking to extradite former Likud campaign adviser Israel Einhorn in connection with the "BibiLeaks" affair.

U.S. forces launched airstrikes against suspected Islamic State targets in Nigeria, an operation President Trump delayed by a day to serve as a "Christmas present." While the administration framed the strikes as a defense of persecuted Christians, experts warn the U.S. may be stepping into a complex local conflict where Muslims are the primary victims of insurgent violence. Nigerian officials anticipate further coordinated attacks following this intervention.

Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope believe they may have captured light from the very first generation of stars, known as Population III stars, which existed more than 13 billion years ago. These stars, identified in an ancient galaxy named LAP1-B, are distinct for their extremely low metal content. The discovery was made possible by gravitational lensing, which magnified the distant light for observation.

A long-standing paleontological debate has been settled with new research confirming that <i>Nanotyrannus</i> was a distinct species of small tyrannosaur, not merely a juvenile <i>T. rex</i>. Two new studies analyzing a specimen nicknamed "Bloody Mary" conclude that these smaller predators coexisted with their larger cousins at the end of the Cretaceous period. This finding challenges decades of consensus that had classified the smaller fossils as young <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>.
