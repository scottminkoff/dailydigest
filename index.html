        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Department of Homeland Security has entered a partial government shutdown after Congress failed to reach a funding agreement by the Saturday deadline. While essential personnel like TSA and ICE agents will continue working without pay, the lapse affects over 13 percent of the federal workforce and has sparked a standoff over Democratic demands for agency reforms. Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill that included new restrictions, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has advised members against travel as negotiations remain stalled.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New polling data indicates President Trump’s approval rating has dropped to 40 percent, a threshold that historically signals significant losses for the president's party in midterm elections. Analysis suggests that with approval this low, the GOP could lose an average of 32 House seats, a scenario exacerbated by the lack of external rallying events like the 2022 <i>Dobbs</i> decision. Trump is currently polling poorly on key issues like the cost of living and immigration, eroding support among critical demographics including Latinos and young men.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna’s application for a new mRNA flu vaccine, a decision critics attribute to the influence of vaccine-skeptic leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services. This refusal overturns previous guidance provided by career FDA staff and breaks with standard regulatory procedures, sparking fears of a chilling effect on future vaccine innovation. Experts warn that this regulatory unpredictability could hinder the pharmaceutical industry's ability to respond rapidly to future public health threats, such as avian flu.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Legal analysis suggests President Trump lacks the constitutional or statutory authority to unilaterally impose new election rules, such as a nationwide voter ID mandate, for the upcoming midterms. Despite threats to do so via executive order if the "SAVE Act" stalls in Congress, the Constitution explicitly grants Congress, not the President, the power to alter state election regulations. Practically, such an order would likely be ignored by state officials, as the executive branch lacks the coercive power to enforce election administration changes on the states.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Republicans have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to allow New York to use its current congressional map for the 2026 elections, challenging a state court order that barred it. The request comes from a GOP congressmember and voters who argue the state court overstepped, and the Supreme Court has ordered challengers to respond by Thursday. This legal battle is reigniting "redistricting wars" in Albany, with significant implications for the balance of power in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York legislative leaders are eyeing reforms to the funding mechanisms of the "Raise the Age" law, though they have ruled out repealing the policy itself. Lawmakers plan to include new funding rules in their counter-budget proposals due in mid-March to address criticisms from counties regarding implementation costs. Additionally, Assembly Member Latrice Walker is pushing legislation to create a "young adult offender" status, which would expand judicial discretion for offenders aged 19 to 25.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The NoVo Foundation, led by Peter and Jennifer Buffett, distributed over $75.2 million to organizations in Kingston and the Mid-Hudson region in 2024. This represents a $30 million increase in giving compared to the prior year, supporting a wide range of causes including schools, farms, and food pantries. The foundation's substantial financial footprint continues to be a major driver for the local nonprofit and activist ecosystem.</p>

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new essay explores the rise of antisemitism in global locales like Bondi Beach, Australia, and how the Jewish diaspora is responding to this pressure. The piece suggests that embracing Jewish identity—"being more Jewish"—rather than assimilation, may be the most resilient antidote to rising hatred. This cultural reflection comes amidst a backdrop of increasing geopolitical tension involving Israel and its adversaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Reports indicate President Trump has given Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approval to attack Iran's ballistic missile program if current diplomatic talks fail. This green light comes as U.S. and Iranian officials prepare for negotiations in Geneva to discuss a potential diplomatic off-ramp. Simultaneously, Trump has publicly stated that regime change in Iran "would be the best thing that could happen."</p>

The joint statement dismisses Russian claims of natural causes, citing the discovery of epibatidine in Navalny's system as evidence of foul play.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.S. government reportedly utilized Anthropic’s Claude AI model to assist in a military operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. While Anthropic denies direct involvement, the tool was accessed via Palantir, raising ethical questions about the use of commercial AI in military contexts. The incident has reportedly caused concern within the Defense Department regarding the approval and oversight of AI tools provided by private tech firms.</p>

She notes that her lack of memory regarding the assaults has paradoxically aided her ability to move forward, though she continues to grapple with the betrayal.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new essay examines the chronic "crisis of the humanities," tracing the current struggles of liberal arts education back to warnings first raised in a 1964 commission report. The piece argues that multibillion-dollar foundations now effectively control the direction of research through their funding power, prioritizing specific ideological or practical outcomes. The author suggests today's educational emergency is not new, but the latest phase of a decades-long erosion of support for the humanities.</p>

The administration is reportedly confident the Supreme Court will uphold the repeal due to recent rulings that limit the power of federal agencies. Opponents fear that a loss at the high court could permanently handicap the federal government's ability to regulate climate pollutants.</p>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jerusalem Demsas argues that "scarcity politics" is eating liberalism by convincing voters that one group's success is inevitably another's failure. She contends that artificial scarcity, particularly in housing, validates this zero-sum worldview and pushes voters toward anti-growth, exclusionary policies. Liberalism, she concludes, can only survive if it delivers abundance that proves prosperity can be shared rather than rationed.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Matthew Yglesias critiques the American presidential system, arguing that fusing the head of state and head of government into one person is a fundamental design flaw. He suggests this structure exacerbates polarization because presidents use the ceremonial power of the state to advance partisan agendas, alienating half the country. Yglesias contrasts this with parliamentary systems where symbolic leadership is separated from political governance, creating a more stable national identity.</p>
