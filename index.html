        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act expire today, a deadline that could result in steep premium hikes for approximately 22 million enrollees starting tomorrow. This expiration serves as the culmination of the longest government shutdown in history, which was sustained by partisan arguments over whether to extend these specific tax credits. Analysts project that without intervention, premiums could rise by an average of 114 percent, disproportionately affecting older Americans and those in specific geographic regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump issued the first two vetoes of his second term, rejecting bipartisan legislation regarding a Colorado water pipeline and the expansion of tribal land in Florida. In a statement regarding the Florida veto, Trump suggested the move was payback against the Miccosukee Tribe for obstructing his immigration policies, while the Colorado veto sparked accusations of political retribution against the state. Representative Lauren Boebert criticized the move, stating she missed the rally where Trump "promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration has abandoned plans to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland following a recent defeat at the Supreme Court. The court's decision in a dispute regarding Illinois narrowed the legal pathways available for mobilizing troops domestically, though the Insurrection Act remains a potential, albeit politically risky, option. This retreat marks a significant de-escalation of the administration's attempts to assert federal military control over Democratic-led cities.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is launching a $100 million "wartime" recruitment strategy specifically targeting gun owners and military enthusiasts. The agency plans to utilize "geo-fencing" technology to serve ads to individuals attending UFC fights, NASCAR races, and gun shows, while also spending heavily on platforms like Rumble. The aggressive campaign aims to rapidly beef up agency ranks to support the administration's deportation agenda.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Justice Department is mobilizing a team of 400 lawyers to review over 5 million pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. This massive undertaking involves prosecutors from national security divisions and U.S. attorneys’ offices in New York and Florida, indicating the scope of the inquiry into the deceased financier's network. The review is expected to take several more weeks to complete as the department sifts through the vast cache of files.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City's 112th mayor in a private midnight ceremony held at the abandoned City Hall subway station. The democratic socialist's ascension marks a significant shift in the city's political landscape, with Mamdani taking his oath on a Quran held by his wife. In his brief remarks from the subway tunnel, Mamdani called the moment the "honor and privilege of a lifetime."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On his final day in office, Mayor Eric Adams vetoed 19 bills passed by the City Council and convened a new charter revision commission. This flurry of last-minute executive actions aims to introduce a ballot proposal for open primaries and leaves the incoming City Council with the complex task of organizing potential override votes. The move ensures that friction between the executive and legislative branches will spill over immediately into the new administration.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Incoming Mayor Zohran Mamdani has appointed Kamar Samuels, a Manhattan district superintendent known for integration efforts, as the new schools chancellor. In a reversal of a key campaign promise, Mamdani indicated he would not immediately seek to end mayoral control of the city's school system. This shift suggests a pragmatic approach as he confronts enrollment declines and looming budget cuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Albany defense attorney Jasper L. Mills III has been indicted on felony charges including witness tampering for allegedly disclosing the name of a confidential witness in a murder case. The indictment accuses Mills of endangering the witness by revealing their identity, a significant breach of legal ethics and law. Mills, who represents a defendant in a high-profile fatal shooting case, now faces serious legal jeopardy himself.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Marbletown Supervisor Richard Parete is proposing the consolidation of his town's highway department with that of neighboring Rosendale as a cost-saving measure. The proposal arises as Marbletown seeks to fill a vacant highway superintendent position and considers constructing a new highway garage. Parete noted that since the two towns already share other services, merging these departments could provide efficiencies for both municipalities.</p>

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Moshe Davis, the executive director of New York City's Office to Combat Antisemitism, faces uncertainty regarding his employment as the Mamdani administration takes power. Davis, who has led the office for eight months, stated he has received no communication from the incoming team but plans to report for work on Friday. The situation highlights tension regarding how the new mayor, who has previously refused to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, will handle the city's approach to antisemitism.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downplayed the severity of West Bank settler violence in an interview with Fox News, characterizing the perpetrators as "a handful of kids" from broken homes who "chop down trees." This minimization contradicts reports of organized violence and comes shortly after President Trump publicly expected Netanyahu to "do the right thing" regarding the West Bank. The comments also arrive alongside IDF reports that soldiers were punished for vandalizing Palestinian vehicles.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Israel's High Court of Justice has issued an interim order freezing State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman's investigation into the October 7 massacre. The court's decision responds to petitions arguing that a comptroller probe could compromise a future state commission of inquiry and infringe on the rights of those investigated. Families of victims welcomed the freeze, demanding a comprehensive state commission rather than what they termed a "partial review."</p>

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A New York Times investigation reveals that internal factions within the White House and Pentagon actively worked to sever the U.S.-Ukraine alliance as President Trump pushed for an end to the war. The report, based on hundreds of interviews, details how these internal maneuvers bled the Ukrainian war effort of resources and support. Revelations include secret back channels to Moscow opened during the transition and specific restrictions on munitions placed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Sources close to Prime Minister Netanyahu report that President Trump will allow the reconstruction of Gaza to begin before the complete disarmament of Hamas. This approach indicates a divergence from Israel's stated preconditions for post-war rebuilding, specifically the total elimination of Hamas's military capabilities. Trump reportedly does not believe the return of the body of hostage Ran Gvili should be an obstacle to moving forward with ceasefire phases.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Venezuelan security forces have detained several Americans in recent months amidst a U.S. military and economic pressure campaign against the Maduro government. The detentions occur as the U.S. Coast Guard pursues a fleeing oil tanker, the Bella 1, which has reportedly painted a Russian flag on its hull in an attempt to claim protection. Additionally, unexplained explosions on the Venezuelan coast have led locals to speculate about connections to U.S. operations.</p>

Research suggests hope is a strong predictor of well-being and can even influence physical health outcomes like immune system function. Experts argue that in a time of rising cynicism, hope is an active practice of envisioning a better future and charting the course to get there.</p>

This environment, combined with employee satisfaction, has created a loyal following that transcends typical brand allegiance.</p>

<h4><b>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE</b></h4>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Entrepreneur Mark Cuban argues that the U.S. government should ensure universal health care access where individuals pay what they can afford and the government covers the rest. In an interview, he criticizes both political parties for failing to address the root causes of high costs, particularly the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Cuban suggests his impact is best made by fixing specific market inefficiencies rather than engaging in broader political culture wars.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A recent survey reveals a cross-class and cross-racial consensus among voters favoring broad parental rights over government intervention in child-rearing. The data shows that 54% of respondents believe parents should have the right to raise children as they see fit, compared to only 33% who favor government intervention when decisions are deemed harmful. This sentiment extends to specific issues, with a majority opposing policies that allow students to use restrooms differing from their sex assigned at birth.</p>
