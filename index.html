    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump announced he was cutting ties with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his formerly reliable allies, calling her a "ranting lunatic" on Truth Social and signaling support for a primary challenge. The break followed Greene's recent calls for the release of the Justice Department's files on Jeffrey Epstein and her raising concerns about affordability. Greene responded on X by posting screenshots of her texts to the president and criticizing his attack. Meanwhile, House Republican leaders plan to hold a vote on Tuesday on legislation that would force the full release of all Epstein records from the DOJ. The president ordered the Justice Department to investigate ties between Epstein and prominent Democrats, an assignment given to Jay Clayton of the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the government shutdown, funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is now flowing again to the nearly 3 million New Yorkers who rely on it. On Capitol Hill, some moderate House Republicans are pushing for a deal to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent premium hikes. A Times investigation found that the Trump administration has transformed the Department of Homeland Security to carry out its deportation campaign, diverting resources from efforts to combat child predators and sex trafficking. In Charlotte, N.C., Border Patrol began a new immigration crackdown over the weekend, with federal agents arresting people across the city.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The conservative movement is facing an internal conflict over the influence of far-right figures. The turmoil began after Tucker Carlson hosted white nationalist Nick Fuentes for a friendly interview, which Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts defended, stating "we are joined at the hip with Tucker Carlson." The move sparked outrage among some Heritage staffers and highlighted a broader debate on the right. Vice President JD Vance has remained quiet on the controversy, which some observers see as a sign of his alignment with the "groyper" movement associated with Fuentes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other political news, the Trump Organization is reportedly in talks to bring a Trump-branded property to a major Saudi government real estate project overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A new federal ethics report revealed that a Federal Reserve governor who stepped down in August had repeatedly violated the central bank's stock trading rules. In Indiana, the Republican-led state Senate will not convene to redraw congressional maps, a significant blow to the White House's efforts to shore up the GOP House majority through redistricting. Lastly, the U.S. penny was officially discontinued this week after 232 years.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the ongoing race for New York City Council speaker, the Brooklyn delegation, the largest in the council, is looking to unite as a single voting bloc to increase its influence. According to City & State, Brooklyn Democratic Party Leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is working to unify the borough's 17 members, though they have yet to decide on a candidate. Front-runners for the speaker position include Julie Menin, who has support from Queens and the Bronx, and Crystal Hudson, who is seen as a top pick for progressives. Amanda Farías is viewed as a potential compromise candidate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants as it seeks to increase immigration enforcement in the city. The use of local jails by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already surged in New York this year. In Queens, a judge has ordered a temporary halt to any new agreement between New York City and Mets owner Steve Cohen over the use of Citi Field's parking lot, which could jeopardize Cohen's bid to build a casino there. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Hospital Center may be forced to shut down by the end of the year if it does not receive financial assistance from the state.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to an interview in The Bulwark, the Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has had devastating consequences. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and former USAID official, stated that the halt to foreign aid has led to an estimated 600,000 deaths so far, with 400,000 of them being children. A new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," highlights the human toll, focusing on a Sudanese refugee in Kenya whose daughter suffers from severe malnutrition due to aid cuts. Funding cuts have reduced food rations from the World Food Program to only 40% of the minimum calories required for children, reversing decades of progress against starvation.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Russia continues its assault on Ukraine, with recent attacks targeting the eastern city of Pokrovsk, which could serve as a gateway to other strategic locations in the region. In India, women facing long-term heat exposure in their homes and workplaces report a heavy toll on their health and income. Elsewhere, the BBC is facing a crisis after seven days of silence turned a controversy over the editing of a speech by President Trump into a major issue.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A growing number of Americans are turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, citing long wait times, inattentive doctors, and high costs in the traditional healthcare system. According to The New York Times, users appreciate the bots' encyclopedic knowledge and empathetic, agreeable tone. However, medical professionals express concern over the bots' tendency to provide incomplete or fabricated answers for high-stakes health decisions. While some doctors find that patients arrive at appointments better informed, others worry about patients cutting them out of the process entirely.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In media news, the cable channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW. The change is part of a reported $20 million effort to adapt to a splintering media ecosystem where cable's influence has diminished. In San Francisco, driverless taxis were thriving until one of them killed a beloved cat, sparking new debate about the technology. Meanwhile, journalist Olivia Nuzzi is releasing a new book about her career-altering digital relationship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro has released his adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" on Netflix. A review in The Atlantic finds the production handsome but emotionally "inert." In scientific breakthroughs, researchers have sequenced RNA from a 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth, by far the oldest on record. The study also revealed that the famous mammoth mummy, Yuka, was male, not female as previously believed.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch featured a debate on the future of the Senate filibuster. John McCormack argues that while frustrating, the filibuster encourages bipartisanship and prevents wild policy swings, and we will miss it when it's gone. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/filibuster-senate-partisanship-executive-overreach/">Read more.</a> Andrew Egger counters that the filibuster no longer delivers good outcomes, instead weakening an already impotent Congress and contributing to gridlock and executive overreach. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/debates/senate-filibuster-gridlock-conservatives-congress/">Read more.</a></p>
