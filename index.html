        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump announced he is ending the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, Oregon, following a defeat at the Supreme Court regarding the operation. This decision marks a significant, albeit potentially temporary, de-escalation in the conflict between the administration and local Democratic officials over the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Trump framed the withdrawal as a pause, stating on social media that troops might return "in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">House Republicans have released the transcript of former special counsel Jack Smith’s closed-door deposition, in which he staunchly defended his investigation into the 2020 election aftermath. Smith rebutted claims of political bias and detailed his prosecutorial strategy, asserting that his case was built largely on testimony from Trump's own allies. He notably refused to attack Republicans for denying him a public hearing while maintaining his view that the President committed a historic crime.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Former Senator Ben Sasse has revealed a diagnosis of advanced cancer, using the announcement to offer a reflection on mortality and integrity in politics. Sasse, who left the Senate to serve as president of the University of Florida before stepping down in 2024, framed his diagnosis without vindictiveness, emphasizing a message of hope and resilience. Observers note that his tenure represented an attempt to maintain reason in a dysfunctional political era.</p>

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Zohran Mamdani was officially sworn in as the 112th mayor of New York City in a private ceremony held just after midnight in the abandoned City Hall subway station. The inauguration of the socialist lawmaker marks a significant shift in the city's political landscape, though he has already surprised some by reversing his stance on mayoral control of schools. Mamdani stated during the ceremony that leading the city is "truly the honor and privilege of a lifetime."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Republican lawmakers in Ulster County have formally opposed the proposed Terra-Gen battery storage facility planned for the town of Ulster. In a press release issued late Tuesday, the nine-member caucus went on the record against the project, which would be located at the Coleman High School site. This opposition adds a layer of political conflict to the renewable energy infrastructure debate within the county.</p>

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The number of active-duty IDF soldiers who died by suicide reached 22 in 2025, marking a 15-year high for the military. This statistic, falling just short of the 2010 record, underscores the severe mental health toll the prolonged conflict is taking on Israeli troops. The data was updated following the death of a soldier from the combat engineer corps on Wednesday.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A coalition of 19 Israel-based human rights NGOs has condemned the government's decision to bar dozens of international aid groups from operating in Gaza. The organizations argue that this move compromises effective aid delivery and endangers both humanitarian staff and local communities. The government has faced criticism that this policy is an attempt to blur responsibility for humanitarian failures in the region.</p>

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A fire at a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana during New Year's Eve celebrations has left approximately 40 people dead and injured over 100 others. Officials believe the blaze was followed by an explosion likely caused by a flashover, a phenomenon where fire spreads rapidly in an enclosed space. The severity of the incident has overwhelmed local burn units, requiring patients to be transported to neighboring countries for treatment.</p>

<h4><b>CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Americans are demonstrating significantly higher levels of anxiety and skepticism regarding artificial intelligence compared to other developed nations. While countries like Japan and Sweden view the technology with optimism, nearly three-quarters of Americans expect AI to slash jobs, and many distrust its "black box" nature. This animosity is partly rooted in a pre-existing backlash against social media companies and concerns over data privacy.</p>

<h4><b>HIGHER EDUCATION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governments globally are racing to deploy artificial intelligence tools within schools and universities to modernize education systems. This push is being fueled largely by American technology companies seeking to integrate their products into academic curricula. The rapid adoption is occurring despite widespread public concern in the U.S. regarding the long-term impact of AI on employment and privacy.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The small town of Halcott in Greene County, New York, remains geographically isolated from the rest of the county, accessible by car only by driving through neighboring Delaware or Ulster counties. This unique disconnection creates logistical challenges for residents and services, as the "quiet valley" is separated by mountain ranges. Despite historical attempts to improve connectivity, the town remains a geographic anomaly within the state.</p>

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The prevailing narrative that modern politics has become "post-material"—focused on vibes and culture rather than economics—is fundamentally incorrect. Voter behavior and the shift to the right are driven by concrete material conditions, such as high prices and interest rates, rather than abstract cultural grievances. Evidence suggests that cultural issues like anti-trans rhetoric actually polled poorly for Republicans, while economic dissatisfaction remained the primary driver of voter sentiment.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The internet's ability to "delocalize" sports fandom poses a long-term threat to the traditional model of professional sports. While streaming allows fans to follow out-of-market teams easily—such as a D.C. resident raising their child as a Knicks fan—this erodes the geographical loyalty that historically anchored teams to their communities. This shift may fundamentally alter the economics and culture of sports fandom in the coming years.</p>
