    <h4>November 18, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 18, 2025 at 2:30 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House is expected to vote today on a bipartisan measure to compel the Justice Department to release its files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Following months of opposition, President Donald Trump abruptly reversed his position and endorsed the release, after it became clear that many Republicans, including staunch allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, planned to support it. The move came after Trump publicly attacked Greene, calling her "wacky" and threatening to support a primary challenger against her. Speaker Mike Johnson, who previously expressed concerns, will now vote for the bill, telling GOP members to vote their "conscience." The White House now anticipates the bill will pass both chambers and be signed into law. However, legal experts note that a new DOJ investigation into Epstein's ties to Democrats, which Trump demanded, could allow the administration to withhold files deemed part of an ongoing probe.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant legal development, a federal court panel has blocked Texas Republicans’ new congressional map, ruling it was likely an illegal racial gerrymander and ordering the midterm election to be held under the state’s previous district lines. The ruling is expected to be appealed. Separately, a federal judge stated he might dismiss charges against former FBI Director James Comey due to a "disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps" by the Trump-appointed prosecutor. The judge ordered the Justice Department to provide Comey's defense team with complete grand jury records. In another legal victory for a Trump opponent, lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James filed court documents showing that Fannie Mae officials did not believe there was strong evidence of mortgage fraud against her, and accused a top housing official of abusing his power to target the president's political rivals.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Supreme Court announced it will hear <i>Watson v. RNC</i>, a case challenging Mississippi's law that allows mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they are received up to five days later. The outcome could affect mail ballot deadlines in 16 states and the District of Columbia. In other election law news, a new Montana law requiring voters to write their birth year on mail ballot return envelopes has led to a rejection rate of 3-4% in some counties. A federal judge also blocked a Trump executive order that sought to require proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump is hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. During an Oval Office meeting, Trump sided with the Crown Prince over U.S. intelligence agencies, stating that Mohammed "knew nothing about" the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and had been "incredible" on human rights. Trump also announced he would approve the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. In other administration news, the Trump administration plans to close the Department of Education, and David Richardson, the acting head of FEMA, resigned after six months on the job. Additionally, a CNN review revealed that Tammy Bruce, Trump's nominee for deputy U.N. ambassador, has a history of promoting inflammatory and anti-Muslim claims.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Congress, Republicans are debating whether to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. While some moderate Republicans are open to a deal, Trump has hardened his position against an extension, writing on Truth Social that he would only support sending money "directly back to the people." Meanwhile, federal immigration enforcement surges are expanding in North Carolina, with over 200 arrests reported in Charlotte as operations are expected to begin in Raleigh.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new Siena College poll shows Gov. Kathy Hochul holding a 20-point lead, 52% to 32%, over her announced Republican challenger, Rep. Elise Stefanik, in a potential 2026 gubernatorial race. The poll also found Hochul with a commanding 56% to 16% lead over Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in a hypothetical Democratic primary. However, Hochul's favorability rating is underwater at 43-45%, and only 39% of voters believe the state is on the right track. The survey also revealed low approval for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose unfavorable rating hit an all-time high of 55%.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Council Member Chi Ossé has filed to launch a primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries from the left. However, prominent progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani signaled they do not support the challenge, with Ocasio-Cortez stating it is not a good idea "right now." Meanwhile, longtime state Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs announced he will remain in his position despite refusing to endorse Mamdani in the mayoral general election.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor Eric Adams is continuing his international travels, visiting Uzbekistan for a multiday trip after completing an official visit to Israel. Back in New York, the Adams administration announced the city met its targets under the state's class size reduction law, but reports indicate this was achieved by declaring thousands of classrooms exempt from the requirements. The mayor also increased the city's budget for the current fiscal year by $2 billion, leaving a projected $4.7 billion deficit for the incoming Mamdani administration to close.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indefinitely canceled naturalization ceremonies in at least seven upstate New York counties, leaving hundreds of prospective citizens in limbo. In other state news, Gov. Hochul is sparring with the White House over the release of $400 million in federal funds for a program that helps New Yorkers with their heating bills.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United Nations Security Council voted to approve President Trump's peace plan for Gaza, a move that provides a U.N. mandate for creating a multinational stabilization force and establishing a transitional government to rebuild the territory. Russia and China abstained from the vote, but multiple Arab and Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey, backed the deal. The vote gives the administration's 20-point plan the weight of international law. Following the ceasefire, Germany announced it would resume arms exports to Israel that it had paused in August. In the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned growing violence from settlers after extremists attacked a Palestinian village, burning cars and homes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In New York, the leader of a neo-Nazi group admitted to organizing hate attacks, including a plot to distribute poisoned candy to Jewish children in New York City.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new space race is underway between the United States and China, which plans to land its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. According to The Dispatch, China's National Space Administration has a narrow focus on the moon and has already completed successful unmanned missions to its far side, a region NASA has yet to reach. These missions have returned rock samples and are aimed at exploring craters that may hold frozen water, a key resource for establishing a human presence. While NASA's Artemis III manned mission is scheduled, recent reports suggest it has been delayed until at least 2028.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 100 Rafale fighter jets and other defense systems from France. This comes as Russian forces launched a deadly drone and missile attack on the Ukrainian cities of Dnipro and Kharkiv. In neighboring Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk described an explosion on a railway line used to supply Ukraine as an "unprecedented act of sabotage," likely carried out on orders from "foreign services."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last year, was sentenced to death in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity for ordering the use of lethal force against protestors in 2024. In business policy, European Union officials are scaling back the bloc's landmark data privacy law, known as GDPR, shifting toward a more U.S.-style, hands-off approach to big tech.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a victory for President Trump's antitrust efforts, a federal judge ruled that Meta did not create an illegal monopoly when it acquired WhatsApp and Instagram, dealing a blow to an FTC case that could have led to the company's breakup.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a novel use of technology to study nature, researchers are outfitting monarch butterflies with tiny, solar-powered radio tags to track their migration to Mexico. As reported by The New York Times, the tags weigh only 60 milligrams and could provide new insights into the life cycles of butterflies, bees, and other declining insect populations. A free app allows the public to follow the journeys of individual tagged butterflies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The documentary film landscape is facing a crisis of trust. According to The New York Times, a combination of technological advances in AI and a trend of "authorized documentaries" where subjects retain editorial control is undermining the relationship between viewers and filmmakers. This erosion of trust raises concerns about the integrity of historical records.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the automotive and e-commerce world, Ford has partnered with Amazon to sell used cars on the online platform, becoming the second automaker to do so after Hyundai. Billionaire Jeff Bezos has also co-founded a new artificial intelligence startup called Project Prometheus, which will focus on engineering and manufacturing for computers, cars, and rockets. Meanwhile, Sotheby's is set to auction Gustav Klimt’s "Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer" with an estimate of $150 million.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The sports media landscape continues to fracture, making it increasingly difficult for fans to watch their favorite teams. An article in The Atlantic highlights how fans now need multiple, often expensive, streaming services—such as Prime Video, MSG+, and Peacock, in addition to traditional channels like ESPN—to follow a single team like the New York Knicks through a season.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Former Treasury Secretary and Harvard professor Larry Summers said he was "deeply ashamed" of his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement reported by The New York Times, Summers announced he would step back from his public commitments but will continue teaching at the university.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A report in The Chronicle of Higher Education examines the aftermath for faculty and staff at universities that were spared from cuts after striking deals with the Trump administration. These "lucky ones" are now left to pick up the pieces amid feelings of anxiety and exhaustion. At Duke University, a women's leadership program will now be open to men, one of several changes to DEI programs on campuses across the country.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration released a proposal that would strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams. The move would roll back the Clean Water Act of 1972 and could make it easier for developers, farmers, and manufacturers to pollute waterways. According to The New York Times, the proposal could affect drinking water for millions of Americans and degrade wetlands that store carbon and provide crucial wildlife habitats.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The first doses of the long-acting HIV prevention drug lenacapavir have been delivered to Zambia and Eswatini. The delivery is part of a U.S. government initiative to supply the drug to countries with a high prevalence of the virus. In a separate public health story, an Indiana homeowner was charged with manslaughter after shooting and killing a cleaning woman who had mistakenly approached the wrong house.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The New York Times, William Cohan argues that Elon Musk’s $1 trillion payment plan at Tesla is not a reward for his achievements, but rather a "flex" on those who have opposed him. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/elon-musk-tesla-pay.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/elon-musk-tesla-pay.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Also in The New York Times, Gabrielius Landsbergis writes that Europe must increase its military spending to demonstrate to Russia that the continent is not a viable target, and to show President Trump that it is worth backing as an ally. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/europe-military-spending-russia-trump.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/europe-military-spending-russia-trump.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing for Jacobin, New York City Council Member Chi Ossé explains why he joined the Democratic Socialists of America, stating that only a mass movement can win fights against austerity, real estate interests, and machine politics. <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42593650.34184/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYWNvYmluLmNvbS8yMDI1LzExL2NoaS1vc3NlLWRzYS1tYW1kYW5pLXNvY2lhbGlzbT9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fC795fe8ec">https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42593650.34184/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYWNvYmluLmNvbS8yMDI1LzExL2NoaS1vc3NlLWRzYS1tYW1kYW5pLXNvY2lhbGlzbT9vcmVmPWNzbnlfZmlyc3RyZWFkX25s/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fC795fe8ec</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the Daily News, former New York City Council Member Alicka Ampry-Samuel contends that while the city should not return to the days of illegal hotels, it must amend its short-term rental rules to find a balance that protects tenants without harming lower-income hosts. <a href="https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42593650.34184/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTgvYWlyYm5iLWxpbWl0cy1odXJ0LWxvd2VyLWluY29tZS1mb2xrcy8_b3JlZj1jc255X2ZpcnN0cmVhZF9ubA/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fC21ae13fc">https://link.cityandstateny.com/click/42593650.34184/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnlkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjUvMTEvMTgvYWlyYm5iLWxpbWl0cy1odXJ0LWxvd2VyLWluY29tZS1mb2xrcy8_b3JlZj1jc255X2ZpcnN0cmVhZF9ubA/69114262cbc83b78ed0f436fC21ae13fc</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch's Nick Catoggio analyzes why Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's rebellion against President Trump over the Epstein files matters, exploring the dynamics within the MAGA movement. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/marjorie-taylor-greene-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein/">https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/marjorie-taylor-greene-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein/</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a Slow Boring newsletter, Matthew Yglesias discusses aphantasia—the inability to form mental images—and pushes back on a recent New Yorker essay that he feels offers a one-sided, negative view of the condition, arguing that non-visualizers may possess advantages like more even-keeled responses. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/i-dont-see-images-in-my-mind-and">https://www.slowboring.com/p/i-dont-see-images-in-my-mind-and</a></p>
