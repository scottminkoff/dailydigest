        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are scheduled to meet today at Mar-a-Lago to discuss a 20-point peace plan intended to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting occurs as Kyiv faces intensified Russian missile strikes, with Zelenskyy seeking security guarantees while acknowledging that the final decision rests with the American president. Trump expressed cautious optimism about the engagement, stating that while he believes the meeting will go well, Zelenskyy "doesn't have anything until I approve it."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Utah Republicans are launching a campaign to repeal a 2018 anti-gerrymandering ballot measure, a move that would allow the legislature to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2028 cycle. This effort follows a district judge's ruling that the GOP-controlled legislature failed to comply with the proposition when creating safe Republican districts, leading to the court's selection of a map with a safe Democratic seat. If successful, the repeal would enable Republicans to redraw the lines multiple times within a single decade, securing partisan advantages in a rapidly growing state.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has resulted in over 600,000 deportations and nearly 600,000 arrests this year, though these figures fall short of the campaign promise of one million annually. While the White House touts the operation as historic, conservative allies argue the numbers are insufficient, and civil rights advocates warn of widespread fear among immigrant communities due to tactics like targeting import warehouses. The administration faces a significant legal test this April as the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments regarding an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump reportedly sided with marijuana industry executives over Speaker Mike Johnson regarding the rescheduling of cannabis, a move that significantly softens federal policy. During a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Trump was swayed by arguments from industry leaders and personal acquaintances, despite warnings from senior aides and the Speaker about potential public health risks. The decision marks a major pivot in federal drug policy, aligning the administration with the wave of state-level legalization efforts.</p>

<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is traveling to Florida for his sixth meeting with President Trump, where the agenda will focus on the second phase of a Gaza cease-fire plan and Iranian aggression. While Trump views the transition to the plan’s next phase as a policy achievement, Netanyahu must navigate the meeting carefully to avoid political destabilization at home. The talks are also expected to address concerns over Iran rebuilding its missile capabilities and rising tensions on Israel’s northern border.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An Iranian hacker group known as "Handala" claims to have breached the phone of Netanyahu’s chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, and is threatening to release sensitive data linking the premier’s aides to Qatar. This follows allegations by former spokesman Eli Feldstein that a senior official offered to silence an IDF investigation into classified leaks, implicating the Prime Minister's inner circle in security breaches. Former PM Naftali Bennett described the potential Qatari influence on Netanyahu's office during the war as "the most toxic betrayal Israel has ever known."</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The UN Security Council has scheduled an emergency session to address Israel's unprecedented recognition of Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia not recognized by any other nation. This diplomatic move is reportedly linked to quiet discussions involving the U.S. and Israel regarding the potential resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza to East African territories. The recognition has sparked international concern and necessitates immediate deliberation by the global body.</p>

Analysts warn that the U.S. risks stepping into a long-running, intricate conflict without a full understanding of the local dynamics.</p>
