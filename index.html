<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;"><strong>The Bulwark:</strong> The Trump administration began circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years, potentially including modifications like personal savings accounts and abortion restrictions. However, following immediate blowback from congressional Republicans who lack the "appetite" for an extension, the White House pulled back, stating no proposal was imminent. The situation highlights the administration's struggle between the political danger of rising premiums for 20 million Americans and GOP instincts to dismantle the law.</p>
