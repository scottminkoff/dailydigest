    <h4>November 18, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 18, 2025 at 4:06 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The House of Representatives is expected to vote today on a resolution to compel the Justice Department to release its files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Following a dramatic reversal, President Trump announced his support for the vote, stating Republicans have "nothing to hide." The reversal came after his attempts to lobby against the measure failed to sway key Republicans like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie. Speaker Mike Johnson, who previously expressed concerns about the bill's provisions, said he will vote for it and that GOP members should vote their "conscience." With Trump's endorsement, the measure is expected to pass the House and now has a clearer path in the Senate, though Majority Leader John Thune has not yet committed to a vote. White House officials told POLITICO they now expect the bill to become law. However, some legal experts caution that a new investigation into Democrats' ties to Epstein, ordered by Trump, could allow the DOJ to withhold files related to an ongoing probe.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal magistrate judge in Virginia has ordered prosecutors to provide former FBI Director James Comey’s defense team with complete grand jury records, citing a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.” The judge noted that the indictment, secured by a Trump-appointed prosecutor, “may rise to the level of government misconduct” that could lead to a dismissal of the case against Comey.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a major legal decision, a federal court panel has blocked Texas Republicans’ new congressional map, ruling it was not only a partisan gerrymander but also likely an illegal racial one. The court ordered that the state's midterm elections be held using the previous district lines. The decision is expected to be appealed.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Supreme Court has agreed to hear *Watson v. RNC*, a case challenging Mississippi’s law that allows mail-in ballots to be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day but received up to five days later. According to Voting Rights Lab, a ruling against the law could impact similar provisions in 16 states and the District of Columbia, potentially disenfranchising voters, including military members, seniors, and those with disabilities.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is moving forward with a plan to close the Department of Education and transfer its offices to four other agencies. Separately, the administration released a proposal that would strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, which critics warn could affect drinking water for millions of Americans. The move is seen as a victory for developers, farmers, and manufacturers who have long sought to scale back the 1972 Clean Water Act.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A federal judge blocked a Trump executive order that would have directed the Elections Assistance Commission to add a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form. The judge ruled that the Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to states and Congress, not the president.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On Capitol Hill, a bipartisan deal on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies appears unlikely as President Trump has hardened his position against them, urging Congress to instead send money "directly back to the people." House Republican leaders also favor a broader overhaul rather than a clean extension of the subsidies. Meanwhile, a new analysis identified 109 hospitals, mostly urban safety-net facilities, that are vulnerable to potential Republican cuts to Medicaid.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An immigration enforcement surge in North Carolina has resulted in over 200 arrests in Charlotte, with operations now expanding to Raleigh. In Memphis, however, a state judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard, siding with lawmakers who argued the governor overstepped his authority.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Montana, a new law requiring voters to include their birth year on mail-in ballot return envelopes has led to ballot rejection rates of 3-4%. In the state's largest county, 80% of rejected ballots were due to the missing birth year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), David Richardson, resigned after six months on the job. His tenure was marked by concerns over his lack of experience. According to CNN, President Trump's nominee for deputy U.N. ambassador, Tammy Bruce, has a history of making inflammatory and anti-Muslim comments.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new Siena College poll shows Gov. Kathy Hochul with a 20-point lead over her declared Republican challenger, Rep. Elise Stefanik, in a hypothetical 2026 gubernatorial matchup. The survey found Hochul leading Stefanik 52% to 32%. The governor also holds a commanding lead over Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in a potential Democratic primary, 56% to 16%. While Hochul's numbers have slipped modestly, her favorability rating is underwater at 43-45%. The same poll found Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s popularity has hit an all-time low among New York voters, with a 55% unfavorable rating.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Siena poll also revealed that an overwhelming majority of New York City residents believe Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be good for the five boroughs. However, billionaire Republican donor John Catsimatidis, previously a fierce critic, has softened his stance, saying he wants conservatives to work with the incoming administration. Longtime state Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs has announced he will remain in his position next year, despite having refused to endorse Mamdani.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Council Member Chi Ossé has filed to run in a primary against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, but fellow progressives are signaling their disapproval. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said such a challenge is "not a good idea right now."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor Eric Adams has increased the city's current budget by $2 billion to $118 billion, which is projected to leave a $4.7 billion deficit for the next administration to close. Following his trip to Israel, Adams is traveling to Uzbekistan for a multi-day visit to meet with various leaders. Meanwhile, the Adams administration met the state's class-size reduction mandate by declaring thousands of classrooms exempt from the requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Gov. Hochul is urging the Trump administration to release $400 million in federal funds for a program that helps New Yorkers with heating bills. In other state news, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indefinitely canceled naturalization ceremonies in at least seven upstate counties, leaving hundreds of aspiring citizens in limbo.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a developing congressional race, Chuck Park, a former U.S. foreign service officer, has launched a primary challenge against seven-term Rep. Grace Meng in Queens.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The U.N. Security Council has voted to adopt a U.S.-proposed peace plan for Gaza, a move that provides a U.N. mandate for President Trump's vision to rebuild the region. Russia and China abstained from the vote. The plan calls for creating a multinational stabilization force, resuming aid, and establishing a transitional government. Several Arab and Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey, backed the deal.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ahead of a White House visit from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), President Trump sided with the prince over U.S. intelligence agencies regarding the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, stating MBS "knew nothing about" it. Trump also announced he would approve the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, a move that could draw concern from Israel. The visit marks MBS's first to the U.S. since the Khashoggi murder.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the recent increase in settler violence after extremists attacked a Palestinian village, burning cars and homes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The leader of a neo-Nazi group has admitted in court to planning hate attacks, including a plot to distribute poisoned candy to Jewish children in New York City.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new space race is intensifying between the United States and China, with China aiming to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. According to The Dispatch, China has already completed successful unmanned missions to the far side of the moon, a region NASA has yet to reach. Meanwhile, NASA's Artemis III manned mission, which aims to return astronauts to the lunar south pole, has reportedly been delayed until at least September 2028. China plans its own mission to the south pole's Shackleton crater in 2026 to explore for frozen water, which could be converted into rocket fuel.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk described a railway explosion as an "unprecedented act of sabotage," likely ordered by "foreign services." The damaged line is used to transport supplies to Ukraine. As the war continues, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 100 Rafale fighter jets and other defense systems from France.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last year, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity. The verdict relates to her ordering the use of lethal force against student protesters in 2024, which resulted in up to 1,400 deaths.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump said he would not rule out deploying U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela, where he has recently increased military presence in the Caribbean. In Europe, officials are scaling back the EU's comprehensive data privacy law, known as GDPR, shifting toward a more U.S.-style approach to big tech.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a major victory for Meta, a federal judge ruled that the company's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram did not constitute an illegal monopoly. The decision is a significant blow to the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust efforts, which could have led to the tech giant's breakup.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a first-of-its-kind project, researchers are outfitting monarch butterflies with featherweight, solar-powered radio tags to track their famous migration to winter colonies in Mexico. According to The New York Times, the technology could provide new insights into the life cycles of many declining insect species. A free app allows the public to follow the journey of individual butterflies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump Organization's latest real estate deal, a luxury hotel in the Maldives, will be its first to offer financing through cryptocurrency. This option could make it more difficult to track the identity of investors.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The European Union is scaling back its landmark data privacy law, G.D.P.R., signaling a major policy shift toward a more U.S.-style, hands-off approach to regulating Big Tech.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, researchers at universities that struck unprecedented deals with the Trump administration to preserve research funding have expressed mixed feelings about the arrangements. The administration's significant cuts to science funding have already eliminated financing for 383 clinical trials, affecting 74,000 participants. Studies on infectious diseases and cancer were hit particularly hard. In a separate development, Duke University announced that its women's leadership program will now be open to men, one of hundreds of actions taken on campuses to alter DEI-related programs amid political pressure.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Dispatch, Mark Dalton argues that regulations can inadvertently create monopolies. He writes that while large, established firms can absorb the fixed costs of regulatory compliance, these same costs can crush smaller competitors and prevent new entrants from emerging. He points to the EU’s GDPR, which increased market concentration, and the Dodd-Frank Act, which led to the closure of thousands of community banks, as examples of consumer protection rules that ultimately eliminated competition. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/regulations-compliance-cost-barriers-to-entry/">https://thedispatch.com/article/regulations-compliance-cost-barriers-to-entry/</a></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Also in The New York Times, Gabrielius Landsbergis asserts that Europe should increase its military spending to demonstrate to both Russian President Vladimir Putin why the continent is not worth targeting and to President Trump why it is worth backing. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/europe-defense-spending-trump-putin.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/europe-defense-spending-trump-putin.html</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In his Slow Boring newsletter, Matthew Yglesias discusses aphantasia, the inability to form mental images.
