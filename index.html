    <div class="content"><h4>December 25, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>SCOTUSblog</b> reports that the Supreme Court issued a three-page unsigned order rejecting the Trump administration’s request to temporarily deploy the National Guard in Chicago to protect federal personnel and property, leaving in place a lower court ruling barring the action. Justices Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch dissented. Additionally, federal judges who have ruled against the administration report facing significant harassment and threats.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>POLITICO Playbook</b> details President Trump's accelerating immigration crackdown, noting that ICE plans to utilize renovated warehouses—including massive facilities in Stafford and across Arizona, Georgia, and Texas—to detain over 80,000 people. The administration is also moving to cancel asylum cases for thousands of immigrants with active applications and has ended the H-1B visa lottery system in favor of a weighted selection process based on skill and pay.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The New York Times</b> provides an inside look at President Trump's redecorated Oval Office, which now features extensive gold leafing, five times the usual number of flags, and a red button on the Resolute Desk used to order Diet Coke. The administration has also blocked a peephole used by aides to monitor meetings, replacing it with mirrors.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The New York Times</b> analyzes a new release of nearly 30,000 pages from the Justice Department’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The documents include emails linking Prince Andrew to "inappropriate friends" and confirmation of Trump's presence on Epstein's jet. The release was marred by redaction errors that allowed censored text to be revealed.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>POLITICO Playbook</b> highlights the resignation of two senior legal fellows from the Heritage Foundation amid ongoing internal turmoil. In other political news, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are cited as major beneficiaries of the recent redistricting battles, having successfully mobilized donors and supporters against mid-cycle map changes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The New York Times</b> reports that a coalition of 19 states has sued to block the Trump administration’s plan to strip federal funding from hospitals that provide gender-related care to minors. The policy would cut off Medicaid and Medicare payments to non-compliant facilities.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Times Union</b> reports that Alain Kaloyeros, the founder of Albany NanoTech, pleaded guilty to a federal charge in a deal that resolves the long-running "Buffalo Billion" prosecution and spares him further prison time. In separate legal news, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Department of Justice challenging New York’s Green Light Law, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Daily Freeman</b> covers the veto by Kingston Mayor Steve Noble of a Common Council resolution that would have continued rent control in the city, a move that drew sharp criticism from tenant advocates and state lawmakers. Meanwhile, a lithium-ion fire in Warwick has fueled opposition to a proposed massive battery energy storage system in the Town of Ulster.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Hudson Valley One</b> notes significant leadership transitions in the region, including outgoing Woodstock Supervisor Bill McKenna bidding farewell as the incoming administration rejects a new website and changes locks. In New Paltz, Tim Rogers is transitioning from village mayor to town supervisor.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Daily Freeman</b> reports that the Ulster County District Attorney is seeking to reinstate a manslaughter conviction against Gregory Thayer, which had been overturned by a visiting judge. Additionally, state police are enhancing enforcement on the Thruway following two recent fatal crashes.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaisim and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Haaretz</b> reports that Hamas may be willing to cede power in Gaza to a technocratic Palestinian government as a precursor to disarmament talks, according to regional sources. The U.S. and France agreed to continue implementing President Trump's Gaza plan, though Israel and Hamas continue to trade blame over ceasefire violations.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Gary Rosenblatt</b> highlights a newly surfaced interview with Abraham Foxman, in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly admitted in July 2023 that appointing Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich to his cabinet was "a mistake" and promised to "fix it." Foxman notes that he is "still waiting" for that fix.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Haaretz</b> notes that the Knesset approved a preliminary vote to establish a government-backed commission of inquiry into the October 7 attacks, a move critics say is designed to give Netanyahu influence over the investigation. Meanwhile, Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli called for a full investigation into the "Qatargate" affair regarding alleged ties between Netanyahu's office and Qatar.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Argument</b> explores the cultural phenomenon of Hanukkah's elevation as a "Jewish Christmas," arguing that the minor holiday was commercialized to compete with Christmas. The author suggests that Jews have developed their own distinct Christmas traditions, such as eating Chinese food, which serve as a grassroots alternative.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The New York Times</b> reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed openness to a demilitarized zone in eastern Ukraine as part of potential peace negotiations. In the Americas, the Trump administration's aggressive campaign against oil tankers is reportedly paralyzing Venezuela's oil industry.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>POLITICO Playbook</b> highlights a deepening rupture between the U.S. and Europe after the Trump administration imposed visa bans on European officials involved in combating online misinformation, accusing them of censorship. European governments, particularly France and the EU, have threatened swift responses.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Haaretz</b> notes that Belgium has joined South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel committed genocide in Gaza, joining a list of intervening nations that includes Spain, Mexico, and Ireland.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Atlantic</b> critiques the proliferation of "Year in Review" or "Wrapped" data features from companies ranging from Spotify to Uber Eats. The author argues that while some provide value, many are intrusive attempts to repackage user surveillance as entertainment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Kottke.org</b> shares a collection of cultural links, including a list of bestselling nonfiction books of 2025, a look at AI coding agents rebuilding Minesweeper, and a video essay list from Sight & Sound.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>POLITICO Playbook</b> reports that the White House is dismissing risks associated with Artificial Intelligence in favor of pursuing economic rewards, a stance that contrasts with warnings from economists and Silicon Valley technologists.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The New York Times</b> reports that the Trump administration will begin garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers who have defaulted on their loans starting in January 2026. In other education news, the University of Oklahoma fired an instructor for failing a student who heavily cited the Bible in a paper on gender issues.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Times Union</b> discusses the limitations of free tuition programs for adult learners in the SUNY system, noting that tuition assistance alone is often insufficient to ensure graduation without additional support services.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Bulwark</b> mentions that former Senator Ben Sasse has been diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer. He issued a statement expressing that he is "buoyed by faith" despite the diagnosis.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Daily Freeman</b> reports that a Winter Storm Watch has been issued for Ulster County, with heavy snow accumulation possible. In a separate public health alert, frozen shrimp at Market 32 has been recalled due to potential radioactive contamination.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Bulwark</b> features a piece by Jonathan V. Last criticizing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s selective use of Danish health data to justify scaling back the U.S. vaccine schedule. Last argues that while Denmark does have a narrower schedule, the U.S. vaccinates against more diseases (like rotavirus and meningitis) to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, and that Kennedy ignores the robust social safety nets that contribute to Danish public health.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>ExecFunctions</b> analyzes the Supreme Court's refusal to stay the injunction against Trump's National Guard deployment. The author, writing for the newsletter, argues that while the Court ruled the President must show the "regular forces" are unable to execute laws before federalizing the Guard, Trump still has other avenues, such as the "protective power" or the Insurrection Act, though invoking the latter carries significant political risk.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Slow Boring</b> publishes a reflection by Caroline regarding Feeding America and SNAP benefits. The piece argues that while federal nutrition programs are most effective when they allow recipients flexibility (like the market-based approach of SNAP), recent policy changes adding work reporting requirements create administrative burdens that reduce participation without increasing employment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Atlantic</b> features an essay by Tom Nichols offering an "idiosyncratic" Christmas playlist, moving away from childhood nostalgia toward songs that reflect adult melancholy and the passage of time, such as "Christmas Wrapping" by The Waitresses and "Christmas in the Trenches" by John McCutcheon.</p>
