<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy military troops to Minneapolis following unrest over the fatal shooting of a motorist by an ICE agent. The threat comes as local tensions escalate, with the ACLU filing a class-action lawsuit alleging federal agents violated citizens' Fourth Amendment rights during the protests. Minneapolis Public Schools have moved to remote learning for the next several weeks citing safety concerns for students amid the federal law enforcement presence.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">With the January 30 government funding deadline approaching, Congress appears likely to avoid a shutdown by passing a continuing resolution for remaining appropriations bills. While lawmakers have successfully passed bipartisan packages for agencies including the Interior and Commerce departments, negotiations remain stalled on the Department of Homeland Security bill due to disputes over immigration enforcement. Appropriators view the piecemeal progress as a return to "boring" but functional governance compared to recent years.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers is traveling to Denmark to reassure the NATO ally that Congress will block any military attempt by President Trump to seize Greenland. This diplomatic intervention highlights a deepening breach between GOP lawmakers and the president regarding his aggressive foreign policy stances in Europe. The trip aims to prevent the destabilization of the alliance following Trump's recent rhetoric regarding the territory.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Tariffs on Canadian goods are becoming a central issue in the pivotal Michigan midterm elections, complicating Republican messaging on affordability. While GOP candidates like Mike Rogers argue that lower gas prices will offset consumer costs, industry leaders like Bill Ford note that automakers may eventually have to pass tariff costs onto consumers. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, visiting the Detroit Auto Show, characterized the tariffs as a policy failure that exerts upward pressure on prices.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Six months after President Trump directed Wall Street banks to prepare for a swift public offering of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, no concrete plan has materialized. The administration's push to privatize the mortgage giants is facing headwinds as the President simultaneously emphasizes housing affordability, which could be compromised by higher mortgage rates resulting from privatization. The delay suggests a conflict between the administration's deregulatory goals and its populist economic messaging.</p>

<h4><b>New York State and Local Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A rift has opened between New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and retiring Rep. Nydia Velázquez over succession endorsements in key local races. Velázquez warned the new mayor that "honeymoons are short" and endorsed Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso to succeed her, countering Mamdani's endorsement of socialist Assemblymember Claire Valdez. This split underscores the fragile nature of the alliance between progressive stalwarts and the NYC-DSA.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Council Speaker Julie Menin has penalized Council Member Vickie Paladino for "abhorrent" social media posts about minorities by restricting her to only two committee assignments. In a move signaling a policy shift, Menin also appointed pro-bike advocate Shaun Abreu to chair the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and excluded Republicans from that panel entirely. These assignments reflect the new Speaker's intent to enforce conduct standards and prioritize progressive transportation policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Cook Political Report has shifted its rating for Rep. Mike Lawler’s Hudson Valley district from "Lean Republican" to "Toss Up," signaling trouble for the NY GOP. Conversely, Democrat Rep. Laura Gillen’s seat moved from "Toss Up" to "Lean Democrat," and seats held by Reps. Pat Ryan and John Mannion are now rated "Solid Democrat." Lawler’s campaign responded by citing his fundraising advantage, while Democrats argue his voting record is alienating constituents.</p>

While the total is lower than previous gubernatorial hauls due to new $18,000 contribution limits, she maintains a significant financial advantage over potential challengers. The state Democratic Committee also reported healthy finances with $12 million on hand to support the ticket.</p>

The proposed "New York AI Act" would require developers to prevent algorithmic discrimination in consequential decisions like hiring and mandate third-party audits. Tech industry representatives argue existing anti-discrimination laws are sufficient and warn that onerous state-level auditing requirements could harm small businesses.</p>

This move comes from a Nassau County Democrat, highlighting the administrative challenges in the state's most populous regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has postponed a decision on striking Iran after reportedly receiving intelligence that the regime has halted the killing of protesters.

<h4><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Analysis of Waymo's safety data suggests its autonomous vehicles are significantly safer than human drivers, with crash rates involving injuries or airbag deployments roughly 80-90% lower. Despite public skepticism and a lack of data on fatalities due to their rarity, metrics on injuries and property damage consistently favor the AVs. Critics argue that evaluating safety requires more independent, third-party analysis rather than reliance on company-provided data.</p>
