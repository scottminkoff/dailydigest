    <h4>November 22, 2025</h4>
    <p>Hello, Scott. Here is your updated digest for November 22, 2025 at 5:14 PM EST.</p>
    <div class="content"><h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to The Dispatch and Politico, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will resign her seat in Congress in January. The decision follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump, particularly over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which Greene has championed despite Trump's recent hesitation. While Trump told reporters her resignation was "great news," he later thanked her for her service on Truth Social. In related news, Congress voted almost unanimously to approve the release of the Epstein files, and the Department of Justice is renewing its push to publicly release grand jury records related to the case.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant legal development regarding redistricting, the Supreme Court temporarily reinstated Texas’ newly drawn congressional map, blocking a lower court ruling that had declared the map likely discriminatory against minority voters. The New York Times reports that the lower court had found the map, created at Trump’s behest to aid the GOP in the 2026 midterms, constituted impermissible racial gerrymandering. Meanwhile, a federal judge criticized the government’s handling of the prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey, citing misconduct that may have tainted grand jury proceedings.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On the economic front, The Dispatch reports that the September jobs report revealed unemployment ticked up to 4.4 percent, the highest level since October 2021. President Trump has subsequently rolled back some of his signature tariffs, including duties on food items from Brazil and goods from Switzerland, in an effort to lower prices. Separately, Politico reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated he personally instructed the CDC to remove language asserting that vaccines do not cause autism, drawing pushback from Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician, who affirmed that vaccines have no role in autism.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Regarding immigration, The Atlantic highlights confusion surrounding a Customs and Border Protection operation in North Carolina, where local officials were reportedly kept in the dark about arrests. Politico adds that the Trump administration plans to resume giving immigration officials access to sensitive data on Medicaid recipients and revoked the temporary protected status of Somali migrants.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to Politico and The New York Times, President Trump held a surprisingly cordial meeting at the White House with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Despite previously disparaging Mamdani as a "lunatic," Trump praised him as "very rational" and complimented his campaign, refuting the "jihadist" label applied to Mamdani by Rep. Elise Stefanik. Mamdani’s team noted that Trump expressed a willingness to help make the city more affordable.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other city political news reported by City & State NY, Rep. Nydia Velázquez announced she will retire, signaling a desire for generational change. Meanwhile, Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano is actively courting NYC businesses that may be wary of Mamdani’s democratic socialist platform. Mayor Eric Adams will reportedly break tradition by not hosting a final holiday celebration at Gracie Mansion.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Several significant legal and criminal justice stories emerged in the region. The New York Times reports that federal prosecutors filed court papers defending their decision to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, accused of assassinating the UnitedHealthcare CEO. Separately, Edwin Ramos, a detainee at Rikers Island, died following an apparent seizure just hours before he was set to be released on a plea deal. In Ulster County, Trooper Christopher G. Baldner was acquitted of murder and reckless endangerment charges related to a vehicle pursuit.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times and Politico report that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky views relations with the U.S. as being at a breaking point following a White House peace proposal that would require Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.

Allies are racing to support Kyiv, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has engaged in discussions with President Trump.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Latin America, The New York Times reports that the U.S. Navy’s positioning in the Caribbean suggests the Trump administration is prioritizing pressure on the Venezuelan government over counternarcotics operations. Politico notes that Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s political future may hinge on the success of this campaign to oust Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">404 Media reports on a new study published in <em>Current Biology</em> regarding a "matricidal" ant species where parasitic queens spray acid on host queens, tricking worker ants into killing their own mother. In space news, spores from the moss <em>Physcomitrium patens</em> were found to survive and remain reproductive after 283 days on the exterior of the International Space Station. Additionally, a new study in <em>Science</em> suggests the protoplanet Theia, which collided with Earth to form the Moon, likely originated in the inner solar system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In the entertainment sector, The Atlantic and The New York Times reviewed the film "Wicked: For Good," noting that while the first installment was a hit, the sequel takes a darker turn and faces the challenge of concluding a split narrative. Meanwhile, The New York Times reports that Roblox has introduced a facial scanning system to assess user ages.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie posits that the Trump administration is engaged in a "war of attrition" to consolidate a personalist regime, using a Civil War analogy to suggest that rapid alienation of the public could mire the president in political quagmire. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/opinion/trump-civil-war-confederacy-politics.html">Link to The New York Times</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In The Atlantic, David A. Graham reports from Durham, North Carolina, arguing that a lack of transparency regarding Border Patrol operations is a deliberate strategy by the administration to keep local officials in the dark and create a vacuum of fear. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/11/border-patrols-chaotic-week-in-north-carolina/680746/">Link to The Atlantic</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kevin Williamson writes in The Dispatch that Trump’s recent tariff rollbacks following gifts from Swiss executives demonstrate a transactionalist approach where "affordability" is suddenly discovered when politically convenient. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/wanderland/trump-tariffs-debt-rolex-bribery/">Link to The Dispatch</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Errol Louis writes in New York Magazine that the deepest fear of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's critics is not that he will fail, but that he has a genuine chance of succeeding in leading the city. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/zohran-mamdanis-next-act.html?oref=csny_firstread_nl">Link to New York Magazine</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mara Gay argues in The New York Times that Trump's effusive response to Mamdani illustrates the Mayor-elect's sharp political instincts and ability to charm rivals when necessary. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/opinion/zohran-mamdani-trump-meeting-white-house.html?oref=csny_firstread_nl">Link to The New York Times</a></p>
