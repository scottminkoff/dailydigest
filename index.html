    <h1>Good morning, Scott</h1>
    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump has publicly cut ties with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his formerly staunchest allies, calling her a "ranting lunatic" in a Truth Social post and signaling support for a primary challenge against her. The break follows Greene's recent calls for the release of the Justice Department’s files on Jeffrey Epstein and her concerns about affordability. In response, Greene posted screenshots of her texts to the president on X, framing his attack as an effort to scare other Republicans. Amid the fallout, House Republican leaders plan to hold a vote on Tuesday on legislation that would force the full release of all Epstein records from the DOJ.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is reportedly weighing military options in Venezuela, with the president reviewing scenarios that could include the use of Special Operations forces. According to The Wall Street Journal, a classified DOJ brief related to boat strikes in the Caribbean also describes fentanyl as a potential chemical weapons threat. Separately, top nuclear and energy officials plan to meet with the president in the coming days to try and convince him not to restart nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An investigation by The New York Times found that the Trump administration has transformed the Department of Homeland Security to carry out its mass deportation campaign, diverting resources from efforts to combat child predators and sex trafficking. As part of this push, Border Patrol agents began an immigration crackdown in Charlotte, N.C. this weekend. The administration is also reportedly exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Amid blowback over high grocery prices, President Trump issued an executive order rolling back his "reciprocal" tariffs on some agricultural products, including beef, tomatoes, coffee, and cocoa. On the economic front, the government is set to release the delayed September jobs report this Thursday, the first key economic indicator to be published since the end of the government shutdown. Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is now flowing again, though the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) could take weeks to reopen.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Heritage Foundation is experiencing internal turmoil following its president Kevin Roberts' defense of Tucker Carlson for platforming far-right white nationalist Nick Fuentes. According to The Dispatch, the incident has highlighted a broader identity crisis within the conservative movement. Vice President JD Vance has remained notably quiet on the controversy, with some critics, like Jamelle Bouie of The New York Times, labeling him "groyper adjacent."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In other political news, the Trump Organization is reportedly in talks for a Trump-branded property within a major Saudi Arabian government real estate development. The American penny was officially discontinued this week. In Indiana, the Republican-led state Senate has declared it will not convene to redraw congressional maps, a setback for White House efforts to gain House seats via redistricting. Additionally, a former Federal Reserve governor who stepped down in August was found to have repeatedly violated the central bank’s stock trading rules.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A judge issued an order temporarily preventing New York City from entering into a new agreement over the use of the Citi Field parking lot with Mets owner Steve Cohen. The move could potentially torpedo Cohen's bid to bring a casino to the Queens location. Meanwhile, administrators at the Brooklyn Hospital Center are warning that the facility could be forced to shut down by the end of this year if it does not receive financial rescue from Gov. Kathy Hochul.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The covert race for New York City Council speaker is intensifying. According to City & State, Brooklyn Democratic Party Leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is working to unite the borough's large council delegation into a single voting bloc. Front-runners for the position include Julie Menin, who has support from Queens Democratic leader Rep. Greg Meeks, and Crystal Hudson, who is seen as a top pick for progressives. Council Member Amanda Farías is viewed as a potential compromise candidate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In state news, conservationists are again pressing Gov. Hochul to approve a ban on the harvesting of horseshoe crabs in state waters after she vetoed the same measure last year. A federal judge has thrown out a Trump administration lawsuit filed against the city of Rochester over its sanctuary city policy. Additionally, the use of county jails in New York by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has surged this year as the federal government ramps up its deportation agenda.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's decision to halt global assistance and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has led to a devastating human toll, according to a report in The Bulwark featuring an interview with surgeon and former Biden administration official Atul Gawande. He claims an estimated 600,000 people, including 400,000 children, have already died as a result of the cuts. A new documentary produced with The New Yorker, "Rovina’s Choice," follows a Sudanese refugee in Kenya struggling to get aid for her severely malnourished daughter, highlighting the real-world consequences of the policy shift.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Russia has continued its assault on Ukraine, launching a barrage of drones and missiles on Kyiv that killed at least six people.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">According to a New York Times survey, a growing number of patients are turning to A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT for medical information. Readers reported that the bots offer a kinder, more accessible alternative to a medical system with long waits and short appointments. However, doctors expressed concern about the technology's potential to give incomplete or fabricated answers for high-stakes decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Hollywood's box office is experiencing a significant slump for dramas and comedies. According to The New York Times, none of the 25 such films released in North American theaters over the past three months have become a hit.
