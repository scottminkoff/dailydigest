The Department of Justice has issued grand jury subpoenas to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding renovation costs at the central bank's headquarters, a move critics view as political retaliation. President Trump has escalated his attacks on Powell, calling him "incompetent or crooked," though Powell asserts the investigation is an attempt to compromise the Fed's independence on interest rates. The probe marks a significant confrontation between the executive branch and the Federal Reserve, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly warning that the move could unsettle financial markets.

Tensions have escalated in Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of protester Renee Good by an ICE agent, prompting the Trump administration to deploy additional federal officers to the region. While the administration characterizes the enforcement surge as a necessary response to welfare fraud and "disrespectful" behavior, local officials and residents describe the atmosphere as a "military occupation" with agents aggressively detaining citizens and noncitizens alike. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara expressed fear that the situation could spiral into "the destruction of the city," reminiscent of the unrest in 2020.

A federal district court in Washington has struck down key provisions of President Trump’s March 2025 executive order on elections, ruling them violations of the constitutional separation of powers. The blocked mandates included a requirement for documentary proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms and a prohibition on counting mail ballots received after Election Day. This marks the third federal court to rule against the order, reinforcing judicial resistance to executive changes in election administration.

The Department of Homeland Security announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 2,500 Somali immigrants, claiming conditions in Somalia have improved sufficiently. This decision aligns with the administration's broader crackdown on immigration and coincides with intensified rhetoric from President Trump targeting the Somali diaspora in Minnesota. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that allowing Somali nationals to remain is "contrary to our national interests."

Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have refused to comply with subpoenas from the House Oversight Committee regarding its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The Clintons' legal team argues the subpoenas are "legally invalid" and politically motivated, setting up a potential contempt of Congress vote next week. Committee Chair James Comer has indicated plans to move forward with contempt proceedings if Hillary Clinton does not appear for her scheduled testimony.

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Governor Kathy Hochul delivered her fifth State of the State address, focusing heavily on affordability issues like child care, medical costs, and housing production while positioning New York as a bulwark against the Trump administration. The Governor proposed scaling back environmental reviews to spur housing construction and enacting a ban on ICE entering "sensitive locations" like schools and hospitals without a warrant. Despite the "affordability" theme, Republicans criticized the speech as a "wishlist of radical left-wing proposals," while some Democrats felt her universal child care plans fell short of the actual need.

Activist Cameron Kasky has dropped out of the crowded Democratic primary for New York’s 12th Congressional District, stating he will instead focus on advocating for human rights in the West Bank. The race to replace Rep. Jerry Nadler remains highly competitive, with high-profile candidates like George Conway—who raised over $1 million in 48 hours—and Assemblymember Micah Lasher vying for the nomination. Kasky noted that while he is leaving the race, his "West Bank human rights plan" is likely to resonate with the remaining progressive candidates.

Trump declared on Truth Social that "help is on the way," signaling a significant shift toward interventionism despite his isolationist rhetoric elsewhere.

Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are meeting with foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland to discuss the administration's stated desire to acquire the territory. While Greenland’s prime minister has firmly rejected the idea, stating the country would choose to remain with Denmark, President Trump dismissed this stance, warning it would be "a big problem for him." European leaders are reportedly scrambling to find a conciliatory deal, such as NATO security bolstering or mineral rights, to appease the U.S. without ceding sovereignty.

A new analysis highlights that elevators in North America cost nearly three times as much to install and maintain compared to peer nations in Europe and Asia. The discrepancy is largely attributed to bespoke manufacturing requirements and distinct maintenance labor practices that differ from the standardized models used elsewhere. As noted by industry observers, these inflated costs significantly impact affordable housing and infrastructure projects across the continent.

A growing online discourse is challenging the "white-knuckle" approach to parenting, arguing against the moralization of sacrificing personal happiness for performative child engagement. Critics argue that quality interaction does not require parents to endure activities they detest, suggesting that structuring family life to align with shared interests is healthier for both parent and child. This conversation pushes back against the intensity of modern parenting standards that equate difficulty with virtue.

<h4><b>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The stoker for a stapler is actually called an "anvil," and many models feature a rotating plate that changes the staple direction from inward (for permanent fastening) to outward (for temporary pinning). While a staple of office design since the mid-20th century, the "pinning" function is rarely used by modern workers. This mechanical quirk remains a standard feature despite its obsolescence in daily use.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Jonathan Cohn argues that Donald Trump is repurposing Ronald Reagan’s "welfare queen" playbook by targeting Somali immigrants in Minnesota to fuse his anti-immigration and anti-welfare agendas. However, Cohn suggests this strategy may backfire, as the public is increasingly sympathetic to the targets of these crackdowns, unlike the political climate of the 1970s. The piece posits that the brutality of recent enforcement actions, such as the killing of Renee Good, is alienating voters rather than galvanizing them.

Matthew Yglesias highlights that while Mississippi and Alabama have seen test score surges, public school performance in most "red states" like Texas and Florida is actually declining. He argues that the conservative focus on vouchers and dismantling teacher unions has failed to deliver the educational improvements seen in states that focused on curriculum reform and accountability. The data suggests that partisan governance models are not a reliable predictor of educational quality.
