        <h4><b>US NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President-elect Trump is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago today to discuss a potential framework for ending the war. While Trump expressed optimism that the meeting would "go good," he emphasized his control over the process, noting that any concessions or plans are invalid "until I approve it." This meeting occurs against a backdrop of intensified Russian airstrikes on Kyiv, raising the stakes for Zelenskyy’s diplomatic mission.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Utah Republicans are launching a campaign to repeal a voter-approved anti-gerrymandering measure, aiming to allow the legislature to redraw congressional maps before the 2028 cycle. If successful, the state could see four different electoral maps within eight years, a move critics argue is designed to eliminate a newly court-mandated Democratic district in Salt Lake County. Organizers have currently gathered only 15 percent of the required signatures as they face a tight Valentine’s Day deadline.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nearly a year into President Trump's second term, deportation figures are hovering around 600,000, falling short of the campaign promise to remove one million people annually. The administration faces pressure from conservative allies to expand targeting beyond violent criminals, while civil rights advocates report widespread confusion and fear within immigrant communities due to tactics like utilizing import warehouses for enforcement. A Heritage Foundation fellow criticized the current operational focus, arguing that efficiency requires that "every category of people should feel that they can be deported."

<h4><b>NEW YORK STATE AND NEW YORK CITY NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Several municipalities in the Mid-Hudson Valley, including New Paltz and Ellenville, have secured significant state funding for infrastructure through the Regional Economic Development Council. The grants, part of a $463 million state package, will finance critical sewer system upgrades and the construction of a 15-unit affordable housing cooperative at the former Elizabeth Manor Boarding House site. Governor Kathy Hochul’s office announced the awards as part of a broader push to revitalize regional economic infrastructure.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Warwick Mayor Michael Newhard has issued a formal warning to Ulster town officials regarding broken safety promises by battery storage developers. Following a second lithium-ion fire at a local facility, Newhard cautioned that developers have failed to uphold safety commitments made during the approval process. The warning comes as municipalities across New York grapple with the safety protocols required for the state's aggressive renewable energy storage expansion.

<h4><b>JUDAISM AND ISRAEL</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is traveling to Florida for his sixth meeting with President Trump since the election, with the agenda dominated by the Gaza cease-fire and Iranian containment. Analysts suggest Netanyahu is navigating a delicate political balance, needing to align with U.S. efforts to transition to the "second phase" of the Gaza plan without alienating his right-wing coalition partners. Amos Harel notes that Netanyahu must avoid a public clash with Trump, as it would "further destabilize his already precarious domestic political situation."

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">An Iranian hacker group known as "Handala" claims to have breached the phone of Netanyahu's chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, and is threatening to release sensitive intelligence. The group has published footage alleging that Netanyahu's inner circle used "lavish" religious gatherings as cover for secret political dealings and links to Qatar. This cyber operation targets the Prime Minister's office amid the ongoing "Qatargate" scandal involving alleged illicit funding.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The UN Security Council has scheduled an emergency session to address Israel's formal recognition of Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia not recognized by any other nation. Reports indicate this diplomatic maneuver serves a strategic purpose, with U.S. and Israeli officials allegedly discussing the use of Somaliland territory for the resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza. The move has drawn sharp rebuke for defying the African Union's stance on colonial borders and sovereignty.

<h4><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND POLITICS</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Myanmar held its first general election today since the military junta seized control of the country in a 2021 coup. International observers have widely condemned the vote as a sham exercise designed to legitimize the military's authority amid ongoing civil war and the suppression of political opposition. The ruling junta is expected to maintain its grip on power through this tightly controlled process.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Italian authorities have arrested nine individuals suspected of funneling approximately 7 million euros to Hamas through a network of charitable organizations. Prosecutors identified Mohammad Hannoun, president of the Palestinian Association in Italy, as the alleged leader of the cell, accusing the group of disguising terror financing as humanitarian aid. Italy's Interior Minister stated the operation "lifted the veil" on activities that exploited pro-Palestinian sentiment to support terrorist infrastructure.

<h4><b>CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">French cinema icon Brigitte Bardot has died at the age of 91, leaving behind a legacy defined by both her mid-century stardom and her later animal rights activism. After retiring from film in 1973, she leveraged her immense fame to advocate for animal welfare, though her reputation was often complicated by her controversial and divisive political statements. She remains a symbol of the sexual revolution of the 1950s and 60s.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New paleontological research has seemingly resolved a decades-long debate by confirming that the <i>Nanotyrannus</i> was a distinct species, rather than merely a juvenile <i>T. rex</i>. The analysis of a nearly complete specimen nicknamed "Bloody Mary" provided the skeletal evidence needed to prove the pint-sized predator represents a unique lineage. This finding suggests a greater diversity of large predators existed at the end of the Cretaceous period than previously understood.

<h4><b>HIGHER EDUCATION</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A new analysis warns that declining academic standards and lowered expectations are driving a slide toward functional illiteracy in the United States. The report connects systemic educational failures to broader societal issues, suggesting that a retreat from rigor in schools is having long-term cognitive consequences for the populace. <i>The Atlantic</i> highlights this trend as one of the most critical under-discussed stories of the year.

<h4><b>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a significant lapse of operational security, the Trump administration reportedly inadvertently included a journalist in a group chat detailing upcoming military strikes in Yemen. The journalist initially questioned the authenticity of the messages until the bombing campaign actually commenced, confirming the leak. The incident raises serious questions about communications discipline regarding sensitive national security operations within the current administration.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The United States has recorded its first measles death in a decade, involving the daughter of a family in Texas. This fatality underscores the growing public health risks associated with vaccine hesitancy and the resurgence of preventable diseases in developed nations. The case serves as a grim milestone in the ongoing erosion of herd immunity against highly contagious pathogens.

<h4><b>OPINION</b></h4>
<div style="line-height: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Cultural commentators are revisiting the "Merry Christmas" versus "Happy Holidays" debate, arguing that specific greetings can strengthen social bonds rather than merely avoid offense. Eli Federman argues that generic greetings can feel transactional and avoidant, whereas acknowledging specific traditions invites genuine cultural engagement. The debate reflects broader American anxieties about how to navigate religious diversity and identity in the public square.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Writing on the murder of 15 Australian Jews, Hannah Einbinder critiques how corporate media outlets utilize Jewish grief to manufacture consent for military actions in Gaza. She argues that the Jewish community is struggling to maintain space for genuine mourning while their tragedy is politicized to justify the dispossession and death of Palestinians. Einbinder calls for supporting independent media as a "bastion of sanity" amid these institutional failures.
