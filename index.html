    <div class="content"><h4>November 22, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Donald Trump has faced a series of political and legal setbacks this week, signaling potential fractures in his control over the Republican Party. A federal court blocked Texas’ newly drawn congressional map—a redistricting effort pushed by the president to aid the GOP in the 2026 midterms—ruling it was an impermissible racial gerrymander. In Indiana, State Senate GOP leader Rodric Bray is resisting similar pressure from the White House to redraw maps, stating that such moves could damage trust in the institution. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the lower court ruling regarding the Texas map.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">On Capitol Hill, Congress voted almost unanimously to approve the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, a measure the president had reportedly lobbied against. Following a falling out with Trump over the issue, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will resign her seat in Congress in January. Additionally, the September jobs report, delayed by the government shutdown, revealed that unemployment ticked up to 4.4 percent, the highest level since October 2021. In response to economic pressures, the administration has begun rolling back specific tariffs, including duties on food items like beef and coffee, as well as tariffs on Swiss goods following a meeting with Swiss executives.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Immigration enforcement remains a flashpoint, with Customs and Border Protection agents conducting operations in North Carolina cities including Charlotte and Durham, reportedly leaving local officials with little information regarding the targets or scope of the arrests. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that the president’s deployment of the National Guard to policing duties in the district was illegal, though the order has been temporarily stayed for appeal. Separately, the White House has requested the resignation of a top aide to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met with President Trump at the White House on Friday, an encounter that defied expectations of hostility. Despite previously trading insults, the two emerged from the Oval Office projecting civility; Trump described Mamdani as a "very rational person" and predicted he would be a "great mayor," while Mamdani termed the meeting "productive." The discussion reportedly covered housing, affordability, and energy costs, with Trump blaming Con Edison for high prices. The meeting has caused friction within the MAGA coalition, with some allies confused by the president's embrace of a democratic socialist.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In Congress, Rep. Nydia Velázquez announced she will retire after 16 terms, opening a seat in a district spanning parts of Brooklyn and Queens and signaling a generational shift in New York's delegation. Governor Kathy Hochul indicated her office is in talks with Mamdani’s team regarding his proposal for free bus fare, noting that while statewide free transit is impossible, the state is willing to discuss pilot programs to aid affordability. Upstate, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reversed a policy change that had canceled naturalization ceremonies in at least seven counties. Additionally, the state's ethics agency closed its investigation into former state Senate leader Jeff Klein regarding sexual harassment allegations, despite a majority vote finding sufficient evidence, due to procedural limitations.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians in several West Bank villages overnight, reportedly setting vehicles on fire and using clubs. The violence was condemned by Israeli President Isaac Herzog and IDF officials. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio assured him that a pending U.S. sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia would not compromise Israel's military edge.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Domestically, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a new policy prohibiting the display of hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses, following reports it had considered classifying them merely as "potentially divisive." In Pennsylvania, a court ruled that a home seller was not required to disclose the presence of a swastika tiled into a basement floor to buyers. Mark Mellman, a longtime Democratic pollster and advocate for Israel, passed away this week.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is facing intense pressure to accept a peace deal proposed by the Trump administration. The 28-point plan, presented by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, reportedly requires Ukraine to cede territory to Russia and limit its military in exchange for security guarantees. Zelensky has been given a deadline of Thanksgiving to sign on or risk losing U.S. support. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, are coordinating with Zelensky, who stated Ukraine faces a choice between a loss of dignity or the loss of a key partner.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Meanwhile, the Trump administration is ramping up pressure on Venezuela, with investigations suggesting the White House is prioritizing regime change over counternarcotics efforts in the Caribbean. The U.S. Navy's positioning in the region appears aligned with this pressure campaign.</p>

</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nuclear power is seeing a resurgence in the United States, driven by the energy demands of AI data centers and manufacturing. The Department of Energy approved a $1 billion loan to restart a reactor at the site formerly known as Three Mile Island, now the Crane Clean Energy Center, to power Microsoft data centers. Separately, the Department of Transportation unveiled a new advanced female crash test dummy, the THOR-05F, designed to better represent female anatomy in safety testing.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In scientific news, researchers have identified that the moon-forming impactor, Theia, likely originated from the inner solar system. Another study revealed a rare behavior in certain ant species where workers commit matricide against their own queens after being sprayed with formic acid by parasitic invader queens. In entertainment, the film adaptation of the musical <i>Wicked</i> has been released, sparking discussions about its narrative structure and new songs.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The University of Virginia is facing a contentious search for a new president amid political turmoil following current President Jim Ryan's recent disclosures. Questions regarding the future of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are complicating the process. At Montclair State University, a plan to reorganize 15 departments into four schools has sparked faculty concern over the relevance of academic fields, despite administration claims it will foster interdisciplinarity. Additionally, the American Musicological Society is facing a member revolt and threats of a boycott over governance and equity demands.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral was held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., attended by figures including President Biden and former President George W. Bush. The operator of New York’s energy grid, NYISO, warned that the state is at an "inflection point," with aging fossil fuel infrastructure retiring while demand from data centers and electrification grows.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The New York Times</b> guest essayist <b>Jamelle Bouie</b> argues that the Trump administration is mired in a "war of attrition" similar to the Confederacy's situation in 1862, where aggressive attempts to consolidate power and remake the nation have alienated the public and created a political quagmire. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/opinion/trump-confederacy-war-attrition.html">Trump is mired in a war of attrition</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Dispatch</b> columnist <b>Jonah Goldberg</b> contends that the Texas redistricting failure illustrates how "breaking norms usually goes awry," arguing that disregarding established political customs and legal guardrails in favor of "simple plans" often leads to unforeseen and counterproductive consequences. <a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/texas-redistricting-trump-norms-2026-midterms/">Beware the Simple Plan</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Atlantic</b> writer <b>David A. Graham</b> observes that immigration agents sweeping into North Carolina left local officials in the dark, suggesting that the administration's strategy involves keeping local leaders uninformed to create a "vacuum" of reliable information and provoke confrontations. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/11/border-patrol-ice-north-carolina-raid/680749/">Fear, Fact, and Fiction</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Racket</b> writer <b>Jonathan M. Katz</b> critiques David Brooks' dismissal of the Jeffrey Epstein story, arguing that public interest in Epstein isn't just conspiracy mongering but a rational reaction to a story that exposes the impunity of the elite and the hypocrisy of right-wing populism. <a href="https://theracket.news/p/why-the-epstein-case-matters">Why the Epstein Case Matters</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Slow Boring</b> writer <b>Matthew Yglesias</b> warns that while Trump may appear to be a "lame duck" due to recent Congressional pushback, his administration remains an "extreme outlier" in terms of personalized rule, citing arbitrary decision-making on foreign arms sales and chip exports. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-strange-new-respect-for-marjorie">The strange new respect for Marjorie</a></p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>The Bulwark</b> writer <b>Jonathan V.

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Jewish Currents</b> contributor <b>Laynie Soloman</b> reflects on the Torah portion <i>Toldot</i>, suggesting that the figures of Jacob and Esau represent not external enemies, but internal human capacities for both study/contemplation and violence that must be acknowledged. <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/shabbat-reading-list/november-21-2025">Shabbat Reading List</a></p>
