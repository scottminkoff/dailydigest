    <div class="content"><h4>November 26, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Hello, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark: The Trump administration was preparing to release a proposal to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years, but pulled back after immediate backlash from congressional Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson reportedly told the president that House Republicans "don't have an appetite" for any subsidy extension. The White House has since stated no proposal is imminent, echoing a familiar pattern of Republicans promising an ACA alternative that fails to materialize due to internal division and political risk.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: The FBI is seeking to interview six congressional Democrats, including Sen. Mark Kelly, who appeared in a video reminding U.S. service members of their duty to disobey unlawful orders. The request is part of a broader Trump administration effort to target critics. Rep. Elissa Slotkin stated the move is an example of the president "weaponizing the federal government against his perceived enemies."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: A federal district judge dismissed indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unlawfully appointed and lacked the authority to bring the charges. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie dismissed both cases without prejudice, which allows the Justice Department to seek new indictments, though the statute of limitations for the charges against Comey has expired.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">POLITICO New York Playbook: President Trump's friendly Oval Office meeting with NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has complicated Rep. Elise Stefanik's gubernatorial campaign. Stefanik has been framing her opponent, Gov. Kathy Hochul, as tied to the "jihadist" Mamdani, a message undermined by Trump's praise for the mayor-elect. In a statement, Stefanik said she and the president would "agree to disagree" on the matter.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Atlantic: Amid the White House's immigration crackdown, the Department of Homeland Security is increasingly using Border Patrol agents for indiscriminate raids in cities, a shift from ICE's historically more targeted approach. This has led to confusion and criticism, as Border Patrol's "area control" tactics, such as swarming Home Depots, have resulted in mistaken arrests of U.S. citizens. Morale among veteran ICE officers is reportedly low due to burnout and apprehension about working alongside less-trained Border Patrol teams.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Voting Rights Lab: The Ohio legislature has advanced a bill that would eliminate the state's four-day grace period for accepting mail-in ballots that are postmarked by the day before the election. The bill also requires additional monthly citizenship checks using Bureau of Motor Vehicles data, which could trigger immediate cancellation of voter registrations. The legislation now heads to Gov. Mike DeWine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced she will not seek a fourth term, stating, "We’ve accomplished what we set out to accomplish." Her decision will set off a competitive race to lead the city.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's transition team has notified Mayor Eric Adams' administration that more than 170 current City Hall staffers will not be retained when the new administration takes office. This is a common practice for incoming mayors as they build their own teams to implement their agenda.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: The New York City Council will not vote on pay raises for its members and other elected officials this year. A planned vote was postponed after it was determined that doing so would violate local law.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: Enrollment in New York City public schools fell by 2% over the last year, marking the largest drop since the COVID-19 pandemic and halting gains made from the arrival of immigrant families since 2022.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Slow Boring: Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's housing transition team includes several notable figures, including Annemarie Gray, who leads the pro-housing development organization Open New York. This appointment is being interpreted by some as a sign that Mamdani may pursue bolder action on housing supply to fulfill the spirit of his "freeze the rent" pledge, which only applies to a minority of housing units.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Times Union: New York State has enacted new regulations for its medical cannabis program, which will allow patients with prescriptions from other states to purchase products in New York. The new rules also aim to streamline the process for certifying patients within the state.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Times Union: New York Attorney General Letitia James is leading a multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration over new restrictions on federal grants for the homeless. James argues the changes threaten housing and services for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: The New York City Council rejected two of Mayor Eric Adams' lame-duck appointees to the city's Board of Health: former Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi and NYC Health + Hospitals CEO Mitchell Katz. The move came after Speaker Adrienne Adams accused the mayor of acting in "bad faith" to undermine the incoming Mamdani administration.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City & State: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is in a period of transformation, with new funding from congestion pricing set to fuel major projects and upgrades. However, the agency also faces significant challenges, including threats of funding cuts from the federal government.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Judaism and Israel</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: Israeli officials have received and identified the body of Dror Or, a 48-year-old hostage murdered on October 7. His wife was also killed during the massacre, and their two children were abducted and later returned during a temporary truce in November 2023. Hamas is still holding the bodies of two other murdered hostages.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: A public feud has erupted between IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir and Defense Minister Israel Katz. Zamir accused Katz of harming the military's preparedness by halting promotions, a move Katz made while ordering a review of the IDF's internal investigation into the failures of October 7. The dispute comes amid calls for an official state inquiry into the attack.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: The Trump administration has developed plans to construct compounds in Israeli-controlled eastern Gaza to house as many as 25,000 Palestinians displaced by the war. While the move could provide relief for the homeless, it raises concerns about entrenching a partition of the enclave and whether Palestinians would be able or willing to move to them.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>International News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: A U.S.-backed 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, reportedly favorable to Russia, was leaked, prompting a flurry of diplomatic activity. After meetings in Geneva, U.S. and Ukrainian officials announced an "updated and refined" 19-point framework that leaves contentious issues like territory and NATO membership for future negotiation. European nations have issued their own counterproposal, while Russia has signaled resistance to the amended terms.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Diplomatic: Leaked transcripts of phone calls reveal President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, appearing to advise a top Kremlin aide on how to "butter up" Trump by praising his peace efforts. The calls also suggest Russian officials believed they could shape the U.S. draft peace plan for Ukraine. The leaks raise questions about Witkoff's perceived pro-Kremlin stance as he is sent back to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to begin serving his 27-year prison sentence for overseeing a failed coup attempt after he lost a presidential election. The court rejected an appeal from the former president, who is a close ally of Donald Trump.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: The United States has officially designated the Cartel de los Soles, a network of corrupt Venezuelan government officials involved in drug trafficking, as a foreign terrorist organization. The Maduro-led government in Venezuela called the move "ridiculous." The designation follows a Federal Aviation Administration warning to pilots about flying over Venezuela, and a letter of support for Maduro from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: The volcanic eruption of Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi, which had been dormant for 12,000 years, has subsided. However, the ash from the eruption has polluted surrounding areas and significantly disrupted air travel for thousands of miles, leading to flight delays and cancellations as far away as India.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: The field of psychology is grappling with how to address men's mental health, with men representing nearly 80% of suicide victims and living shorter lives than women. A debate continues over whether traditional concepts of masculinity are the core problem, with some academics arguing that the field has focused too much on cataloging the "dark side of masculinity" rather than finding effective ways to help men.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Slow Boring: Evidence is mounting that traditional twin studies may have overestimated the heritability of traits like depression by as much as double. More modern methods, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), are yielding lower heritability estimates, helping to solve the "missing heritability" question in genetics.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kottke.org: Chindōgu is the Japanese practice of creating inventions that are not quite useful but also not entirely useless, described as "unuseless." Examples include tiny umbrellas for one's shoes or chopsticks equipped with a small fan to cool down noodles before eating.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Kottke.org: A discussion is underway about the distinction between an "artist" and a "creator." One perspective defines an artist as a "self-directed artistic expressor," whereas a creator is a "self-directed market expressor."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery," the third film in the series featuring detective Benoit Blanc, opens in theaters today for a two-week run before moving to Netflix. The murder mystery, praised as another "bawdy romp," also explores themes of religion and its exploitation.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Higher Education</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Chronicle of Higher Education: Vahid Abedini, an Iranian scholar who started teaching at the University of Oklahoma in June, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and detained for three days while on his way to an academic conference. His colleagues, who organized for his release, fear his detention signals a "new normal" for international scholars under the current administration.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Chronicle of Higher Education: A protest against a Turning Point USA event at the University of California, Berkeley, has triggered two separate investigations by the Trump administration. The most recent review, by the Education Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, will examine whether Berkeley violated the Clery Act, a federal campus-safety law.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Chronicle of Higher Education: New schools and centers focused on "civic and classical education," often pushed by conservative state officials, are emerging at public universities. However, these new programs are so far struggling to attract significant student interest in their courses.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Other Things to Note</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch: A series of recent economic reports paint a mixed picture of the U.S. economy. The producer price index rose 0.3% in September, while private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs per week over the last month. Retail sales saw a modest 0.2% increase, but the Consumer Confidence Index dropped to its lowest point since April.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: An estimated 82 million people are expected to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, a 2% increase from last year, according to AAA. The Federal Aviation Administration anticipates this will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times: America's children are facing a staggering mental health crisis, with diagnoses for ADHD, autism, and anxiety on the rise. While factors like screen time play a role, some experts and parents question whether the high-pressure, standardized-test-focused environment of modern schools is a significant cause of stress and a driver of diagnoses.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Opinion</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Dispatch's Nick Catoggio analyzes the "abusive relationship" between House Republicans and Donald Trump, highlighted by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation. He argues that after years of subservience, GOP lawmakers are facing irrelevance, a party agenda they don't recognize, and palpable contempt from a president who now appears to be a lame duck, possibly leading to more retirements.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">New York magazine's Ross Barkan writes that as mayor, Zohran Mamdani will inevitably alienate some of his leftist supporters. Barkan points to existing sour feelings over Mamdani's expressed desire that City Council Member Chi Ossé not launch a primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as an early example of this dynamic.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Bulwark's Jonathan V. Last suggests that the 2026 midterm elections will be an "event horizon" for the Republican party's relationship with Donald Trump. He outlines two scenarios: either the party deepens its commitment to him, or it finally pushes him aside. A third, less discussed possibility is that a "health event" allows the party to gracefully usher him off the political stage.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Atlantic's Sophie Gilbert observes that the culture war has now fully entered the kitchen, with Thanksgiving meals becoming a new front for political and social division.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times columnist Bret Stephens reflects on Thanksgiving as a time of rebirth.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Times columnist David Byler writes that Democrats lack a coherent agenda on artificial intelligence. He argues that if they don't formulate one soon, Republicans will define the issue while Democrats are left to "stutter."</p>
