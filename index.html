    <div class="content"><h4>November 16, 2025</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">Good morning, Scott. Here is today's daily digest.</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>US News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A significant intra-party conflict is unfolding as President Trump has publicly broken with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his formerly staunchest allies. The feud stems from Greene's push for the full release of the Justice Department's files on Jeffrey Epstein and her criticism of Trump's focus on foreign affairs over cost-of-living issues. Trump called Greene a "traitor" and a "ranting lunatic" on Truth Social, while Greene stated his words could endanger her life. On Sunday, Greene told CNN that while she still supports Trump, his comments were "hurtful."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The dispute comes as the House plans to vote Tuesday on a bipartisan bill from Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna that would force the release of all Epstein records. Massie predicted a "deluge" of Republican support, hoping for a "veto-proof majority," and warned colleagues that a vote against the release would be a vote to "protect pedophiles." Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that Trump is not worried about the files. In a related development, Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to lead a new investigation into Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, following a demand from Trump.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Following the end of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, a CBS poll found that a majority of Americans believe Republicans got more of what they wanted from the deal. Funding for the SNAP program (food stamps) is now flowing again, and the Department of Transportation is easing flight cuts at 40 major airports as air traffic controller staffing levels improve. The delayed September jobs report is now scheduled for release this Thursday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's immigration crackdown has intensified, with a New York Times investigation finding that the Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of agents from combating child exploitation, sex trafficking, and terrorism financing to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants. Border Patrol has commenced a new operation in Charlotte, N.C., dubbed "Charlotte's Web," resulting in numerous arrests, with New Orleans slated as the next target. In recruitment messaging, DHS has adopted a nativist pitch, calling on new hires to defend American culture from "globalists who dilute our culture."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Turmoil has erupted at the Heritage Foundation after its president, Kevin Roberts, defended Tucker Carlson for platforming white nationalist Nick Fuentes. The incident has highlighted a broader identity crisis on the right. Vice President JD Vance has remained quiet on the controversy, which has led some to label him "groyper adjacent," while continuing to use anti-immigrant rhetoric, blaming undocumented immigrants for the housing crisis.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Financial disclosures show President Trump has purchased at least $82 million in bonds since late August. Separately, the Trump Organization is reportedly in talks to bring a Trump-branded property to a large Saudi government real estate project. The news comes as Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Washington next week. The administration also announced it was rolling back "reciprocal" tariffs on certain agricultural imports like beef and coffee amid concerns over high grocery prices.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>New York State and New York City News and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The covert race for New York City Council speaker is heating up, with the Brooklyn delegation attempting to unite as a single voting block to increase its influence. According to City & State, Brooklyn Democratic Party Leader Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is working to bring together the borough's progressive and moderate members to avoid being sidelined as they have in past elections. Council Members Julie Menin and Crystal Hudson are seen as front-runners, with Amanda Farías as a potential compromise candidate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A judge has temporarily ordered New York City to pause any new agreement with Mets owner Steve Cohen regarding the use of the Citi Field parking lot, a move that could torpedo Cohen's bid to build a casino on the site. Separately, officials are sounding the alarm that the Brooklyn Hospital Center could be forced to close by the end of the year if it does not receive a financial rescue from Gov. Kathy Hochul.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration is exploring the use of a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island to hold detained immigrants as part of its wider deportation agenda. The use of local county jails by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already surged in New York this year. Meanwhile, the flow of federal SNAP benefits has resumed for nearly 3 million New Yorkers after a "nail-biting scramble" during the government shutdown.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Conservationists are again pressing Gov. Hochul to approve a ban on the harvesting of horseshoe crabs in state waters. The governor vetoed a similar measure last year.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Trump administration's decision to halt global assistance and dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has created a devastating humanitarian crisis, according to critics. In a new documentary, "Rovina's Choice," surgeon and former USAID official Dr. Atul Gawande profiles the human toll of the cuts, focusing on a Sudanese refugee in Kenya whose daughter is suffering from severe malnutrition. Infectious disease modelers cited by Gawande estimate that the aid cuts have already led to 600,000 deaths, 400,000 of them children, in what he calls a "public man-made death."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">President Trump told reporters he has "sort of" decided on a course of action regarding Venezuela, following days of high-level meetings where military options were discussed. A classified Justice Department brief reportedly describes fentanyl as a potential chemical weapons threat in relation to justifying boat strikes in the Caribbean.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">As the U.S. continues to monitor the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, American envoy Steve Witkoff is planning to meet with a chief Hamas negotiator. Meanwhile, many Gazans remain displaced without access to running water or electricity.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The BBC is facing a major internal crisis over its decision to edit a speech by President Trump, which led to a public apology from the broadcaster. Trump has since announced he plans to sue the BBC for as much as $5 billion.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Culture and Technology</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A growing number of Americans, particularly young adults, are turning to A.I. chatbots for medical advice. According to a report in The New York Times, users find bots like ChatGPT to be an empathetic and accessible alternative to a medical system they perceive as having long waits and inattentive doctors. While some patients feel empowered by the information, medical professionals express concern over the chatbots' potential to provide incomplete or entirely fabricated answers for high-stakes health decisions.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The cable news channel MSNBC officially rebranded as MS NOW this weekend. The change, part of a reported $20 million effort, comes as the channel faces a 34 percent decline in its total audience this year and competes in a splintering media ecosystem of podcasts and newsletters.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In San Francisco, the expansion of driverless taxis has hit a snag after a vehicle killed a beloved cat, reigniting public debate over the technology's safety and reliability.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" is now on Netflix. A review in The Atlantic describes it as a "handsome, burnished production" with a "deep well of compassion," but questions if the final result feels "inert."</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">In a major genetic breakthrough, scientists have sequenced RNA from a 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth, by far the oldest on record. The research on the mammoth, named Yuka, also revealed a surprise: the specimen, long thought to be female, was in fact male.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The Washington Post editorial board writes that the Trump administration's decision to kill the U.S. penny this week was correct, but that it should have worked with Congress to give the coin a smoother, less inflationary exit.</p>
