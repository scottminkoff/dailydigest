        <h4><b>New York State Government and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Governor Kathy Hochul is attempting to pressure New York’s Republican congressional delegation to support a federal waiver essential for maintaining health coverage for approximately 1.5 million residents, including noncitizens and low-income workers. The funding for the Essential Plan is threatened by federal cuts, and while Hochul’s administration argues the delegation’s votes caused the crisis, GOP representatives like Nick LaLota contend the Governor has failed to build necessary working relationships with them. The outcome of this standoff could determine whether the state can afford to continue coverage for these populations without a massive infusion of state funds.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">The New York Court of Appeals reversed a Family Court decision involving child sexual abuse, ruling that video evidence was not properly authenticated to rule out the possibility of it being a "deepfake." Chief Judge Rowan Wilson wrote that given the rise of AI technology, circumstantial evidence was insufficient to prove the videos depicted the defendants, setting a significant new precedent for digital evidence in the state. In a dissenting opinion, Associate Judge Shirley Troutman warned that the new standard creates "insurmountable hurdles" that could allow abusers to escape accountability.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Marc Molinaro is reportedly resigning from his federal post to run for the state Assembly seat he previously held, aiming to replace outgoing Assemblyman Chris Tague. This move marks a return to Albany for Molinaro, a former Dutchess County Executive and congressional representative, shaking up the local political landscape. Meanwhile, in Long Island, Republican Assemblyman Keith Brown has announced he will not seek reelection to a fourth term in 2026.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Tech entrepreneur Raj Goyle has launched a primary challenge from the left against incumbent State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. Goyle is criticizing DiNapoli for keeping state pension funds invested in fossil fuels and companies linked to the Trump administration. He has secured the endorsement of Ali Najmi, a close adviser to NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani, signaling an attempt to consolidate progressive support against the long-time incumbent.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Jury selection has begun in the retrial of Christopher Baldner, a former state trooper charged with murder in the 2020 death of 11-year-old Monica Goods during a high-speed pursuit. Seven jurors were selected on the first day, though the process has been slowed by intense publicity surrounding the case and protests outside the courthouse. Baldner faces charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter for allegedly ramming the Goods family vehicle, causing it to flip.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder anticipates that nearly 200 officers will retire by early March to take advantage of a countywide early retirement incentive. The exodus represents a significant turnover for the department and raises questions about staffing levels and operational capacity in the immediate future. This wave of departures is driven by specific contract provisions encouraging senior officers to leave now.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials retracted a claim that the agency had purchased a warehouse in Chester, NY, for a new detention center. The clarification comes after initial reports sparked local concern and confusion regarding federal operations in the Hudson Valley. Officials stated the earlier confirmation was a "mistake," though vigilance remains high regarding potential federal expansion in the area.</p>

<h4><b>New York City Government and Politics</b></h4>
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor Zohran Mamdani unveiled a $127 billion preliminary budget with a stark ultimatum for Governor Hochul: approve tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, or face a 9.5% property tax hike in New York City. Mamdani positioned the property tax increase as a "last resort" necessary to close a projected $5.4 billion budget gap if Albany does not provide new revenue streams. Governor Hochul immediately pushed back, stating she does not support raising property taxes and questioning the necessity of such a move.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">Mayor Mamdani is appointing Ana María Archila, co-director of the New York Working Families Party, as the commissioner of international affairs, and Faiza Ali as the chief immigration officer. These appointments signal Mamdani's intent to consolidate the city's progressive left within his administration. Archila, a prominent figure in left-wing politics, will now hold a high-profile role in City Hall, further aligning the administration with the WFP's platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">City Council Speaker Julie Menin is pushing legislation to allow the NYPD to establish protest buffer zones around houses of worship, a move sparking tension with the city's progressive Jewish left. The bill follows protests at synagogues hosting events related to Israeli real estate and settlements, which officials have characterized as antisemitic. While backed by establishment Jewish groups, progressive council members and organizations like JREJ argue the bill grants excessive power to the NYPD and threatens civil liberties.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">A coalition of nonprofits has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration for removing the Pride flag from the Stonewall National Monument. The lawsuit argues the removal violates federal law and breaks with the precedent of flying flags that provide historical context at national monuments. This legal battle follows a local ceremony where Governor Hochul and city officials raised a replacement flag in defiance of the federal order.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">State Senator Jabari Brisport is introducing legislation to allow New York City to access state "Raise the Age" funding without needing a financial hardship waiver. Currently, the city has been unable to access nearly $2 billion in allocated funds because it is not subject to the state's property tax cap, a technicality that restricts eligibility. The funding is intended to support juvenile justice reforms and services for 16- and 17-year-olds.</p>
